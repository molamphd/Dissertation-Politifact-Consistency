But the report did not recommend buying 16,000 ventilators, and did not indicate whether the state was at a fiscal position to purchase them. The state did not plan to increase its stockpile because it anticipated that in the event of a severe crisis, there would be shortage of trained staff to operate them and demand would outweigh any emergency stockpile. The report said the state had to balance the likely ventilator shortage with the need for adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses. The report issued guidelines on ventilator allocation if there weren’t enough for everyone and suggested that hospitals designate a triage officer or committee. It explored a lottery system, but did not recommend it as the primary option. Cuomo did not establish one.

Facebook posts,The coronavirus is “simply the common cold.”,"Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","As we reported: There are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of those viruses, which are named for their crown-like structure, can cause colds. Most strains of the coronavirus are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003. According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a ""beta coronavirus"" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012.  All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath — similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory-tract illnesses, like the common cold."" But the same fact sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said. The majority of viruses that cause the common cold are rhinoviruses, according to the CDC. Cases range from mild to moderate in severity, and many adults get two or three colds per year. Children are more likely to get them. In contrast, cases of the coronavirus have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. Older people and those with preexisting medical conditions are more likely to suffer complications from COVID-19, while children are not. The virus has an estimated 3.4% mortality rate. In short, the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December 2019. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold. Despite the differences, prevention for both the 2019 coronavirus and the common cold are relatively similar: wash your hands, avoid touching your face and stay away from people who are sick.

Jim Webb,"In 1968 ""the average corporate CEO made 20 times the average worker’s pay. Today that multiple is about 350.""","Jim Webb is running for president of the United States in 2016.
Webb, a Democrat, served as a U.S. senator from Virginia in 2007-13. He served as the first Assistant Secreatry of Defense for Reserve Affairs and Secretary of the Navy in the Ronald Reagan administration.
Webb is a 1968 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and served as a Marine Corps infantry officer until 1972 and saw action in the Vietnam War, for which he was awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts.
Webb was born in Saint Joseph, Mo. He also has a law degree from Georgetown Law Center, Washington, D.C. He has written fiction and nonfictions books and won an Emmy award for his 1983 PBS coverage of the U.S. Marines in Beirut. He frequently writes opinion columns for many publications.
","Webb said that in 1968 the average CEO earned 20 times more than a typical worker, and today, the ratio is about 350 to 1. His numbers describing today’s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research. Webb relies on a study by the AFL-CIO. EPI puts the figure at 300-to-1. Last year, Bloomberg pegged the ratio at 204-to-1. The University of Southern California put the ratio at 307-to-1 or 420-to-1, depending on how stock options are defined.   There’s no doubt about Webb’s main point: the gap between CEOs and workers has seismically expanded over the last half century. But there’s room to quibble over the numbers he uses. ",Sean Gorman,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/oct/19/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-ceos-make-350-times-more-workers/,mostly-true
Mary Burke,"Under Scott Walker's ""tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year.""
 
","Burke is a former Trek Bicycle executive and former Wisconsin Commerce Department secretary who announced on Oct. 7, 2013 that she would seek the Democratic nomination for governor in Wisconsin in the fall 2014 election against incument Republican Gov. Scott Walker. She lost to Walker on Nov. 4, 2014. She is a school board member in Madison, Wisconsin.
","We found that the income and property tax cuts would save the median-income family at least that much in 2014, although not every average family would save that much, particularly if they are not property owners. Corporations: $610 million Burke overstates the second part of her claim -- that corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. That figure is based on another fiscal bureau memo, which calculates tax savings over Walker’s full four-year term. The memo describes those tax reductions as being ""targeted to businesses,"" not necessarily corporations, which suggests large operations. In other words, some of the tax cuts apply to small businesses as well. For example, $126 million of the $610 million comes from reducing the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Businesses organized like limited liability companies -- whose shareholders pay the firm's tax as personal income tax -- benefit from the reduction. Millionaires: $1,400 per year The third part of Burke’s claim goes back to the 2013 income tax cuts. The fiscal bureau estimated that people with an adjusted gross income of $300,000 or more would see a tax decrease averaging $1,402 in 2014. It’s worth noting that the $133 decrease for what Burke described as the average taxpayer was a reduction of 8 percent, while the the reduction for millionaires is 2.32 percent. And, again, she uses an annual figure for the millionaires, but a monthly one for the average folks. Our rating Burke said that under Walker's ""tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year."" The $11 refers only to income tax cuts, when in fact the typical taxpayer has also enjoyed property tax reductions. The $610 million applies to small businesses as well as corporations. And it’s correct that millionaires got at least $1,400 per year in tax reductions. In short, the claim uses different figures that when mashed together are misleading.
