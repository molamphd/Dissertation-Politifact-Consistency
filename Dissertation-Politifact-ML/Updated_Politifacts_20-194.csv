The memo contained this intriguing concluding paragraph:""As a candidate for the vacant Senate seat in Illinois, Commander Kirk must complete the appropriate acknowledgment of limitations required for all candidates on active duty. ... Ordinarily this acknowledgment must be completed within 15 days of entering active duty. Because of the short period of active duty and concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty, Commander Kirk must complete this form prior to his entry on active duty.""

The fact is, Congressman Kirk never violated Defense Department policies. He has misspoken about his record, acknowledged it and apologized. Mark Kirk left for Afghanistan and he did not engage in political activities -- even in the face of radio commercials accusing him of being gay. The memorandum in question is simply off the mark. Furthermore, this raises grave concerns and questions about who gained access to Kirk's confidential records. The document in question should be viewed for what it is -- a baseless political ploy by partisans bent on defending a U.S. Senate seat at any cost."" The Pentagon, however, later clarified, saying that on two occasions, Kirk was ""counseled"" about violating military policy regarding getting involved in politics while on active duty, and that Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again, the AP reported. Specifically, the Pentagon said Kirk gave video interviews in late 2008 about Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich being arrested. And in July 2009, Kirk or a staff member wrote on the candidate's Twitter account that he was on duty at the Pentagon's National Military Command Center. According to a Department of Defense directive on political activities by members of the Armed Forces: ""In keeping with the traditional concept that members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and that members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement."" Specifically, the rules say that ""a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall not ... participate in any radio, television, or other program or group discussion as an advocate for or against a partisan political party, candidate, or cause.""

He stopped short of acknowledging that he had actually violated military policy, though.

Paul Ryan,"""Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.""","U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R.-Wis., became Speaker of the House in 2015 and served until his retirement in January 2019. Ryan was elected to represent southern Wisconsin in Congress in 1998 and for part of his tenure chaired the House Budget Committee. He was Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate in the 2012 presidential election. He did not seek re-election in 2018.","But surprisingly for Ryan, who is regarded as a federal budget expert, his claim about the law flies in the face of evidence that it actually helps shore up Medicare. What the ACA did on Medicare https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de6b429-1d9a-42de-ad08-c7998eaa6ca5 Here’s how Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, lays it out: On one side of the ledger, Obamacare slowed the growth of Medicare spending by, among other things, reducing increases in payments made to nearly all health care providers. On the other side of the ledger, the law included a surtax on high-income earners that brings more money into Medicare. Two health care policy experts further told us that the combination of spending curbs and revenue increases for Medicare Part A -- which covers hospital, nursing home and home care services, and is financed mainly through payroll taxes -- has extended the solvency of Medicare. (Medicare Part B, which is voluntary, covers doctor visits and some medical care.) Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at the University of Southern California, pointed us to an October 2016 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report noted that in 2010, the Medicare trustees projected that Obamacare’s spending curbs and revenue increases would mean Medicare’s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which finances Part A, would remain solvent until 2029. That’s 12 years later than had been projected a year before the Affordable Care Act became law. (The projection has since been revised to 2028.) Michael Sparer, a professor health policy and management at Columbia University in New York, put it this way, financially speaking: If Obamacare were repealed completely, ""it would put Medicare in worse shape, not better shape."" Finally, it’s worth noting that both Factcheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker also concluded that Ryan’s claim is wrong. They both also noted that, even if the Part A trust fund did become depleted in 2028, the program wouldn’t be broke, in that it is still set up to cover an estimated 87 percent of expenses. FactCheck.org’s rating was false and the Fact Checker gave Ryan its worst rating, four Pinnocchios, which is for statements deemed to be ""whoppers."" Ryan’s office opted not to provide us any information to support his claim. Our rating Ryan said: ""Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke."" Financially, Medicare isn’t entirely in the clear, given that actuaries project that a key reserve fund will run out of money in 2028. But the Medicare trustees themselves, along with a host of experts, say the Affordable Care Act’s changes to Medicare -- including holding the line on spending and raising taxes -- actually puts Medicare in better shape than before the law was adopted. That’s a long way from making Medicare go broke. Ryan said: ""Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.""

In 2006, Senate Democrats — including Biden — rejected raising the debt ceiling to take a stand on spending. Biden missed a debt ceiling vote in 2004 but said he would have objected to it. An analysis from the Urban Institute in 2010 of votes in the preceding years showed that, when in the minority, both parties relinquished the task of raising the debt ceiling on the majority party. When there was a divided government in 2007, raising the debt ceiling was a bipartisan deal. What sets 2021 apart is the Republicans’ use of filibuster to force Democrats to increase the debt limit.

Since it’s too early to know what each party will spend on the next year’s elections, Sanders bases his claim on what each party’s congressional and presidential campaign committees spent in the 2012 cycle. That came to $647 million by Democrats and $675 million by Republicans. These, however, are low-ball figures. When spending by the parties’ state and local committees are considered, the total rises to about $1.1 billion for Democrats and $1 billion for Republicans. On the other hand, Sanders high-balls the Kochs’ plans, pointing their announced goal in January to raise $900 million and not their updated estimate last month of raising $750 million. In either case, the Kochs made it clear that most of the money would not come from their own pockets but from a political network of anonymous contributors. Sanders also overlooks the Kochs’ assurances that only one-third of the money will go to political campaigns, with the remainder dedicated to research and educational programs that ""promote a culture of freedom."" So anyway you dice it, it does not appear that the Koch brothers will outspend either one of the major political parties in next year’s elections.

Wendy Davis,"""Weeks after accepting a quarter-million-dollar campaign contribution"" from a hospital board chairman, Greg Abbott went to court against victims of a drug-taking neurosurgeon.","Wendy Davis, a Fort Worth attorney, was initially elected to the Texas Senate in 2008. She was the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, giving up a shot at winning re-election to the Senate.
","In a TV ad, Wendy Davis said Greg Abbott took a hefty campaign donation before siding with a hospital against patients injured and killed by a drug-taking surgeon. Davis, the Fort Worth state senator and Democratic gubernatorial nominee, consistently depicts Abbott, the state attorney general and Republican choice for governor, as an unethical insider beholden to powerful interests. The narrator of the ad, titled ""Operation,"" says: ""He was a Texas surgeon, performing operations while reportedly using cocaine. Two people died, others were paralyzed. Doctors spoke out,"" the narrator says, ""but the hospital did nothing to stop him. Families and victims sued the hospital. ""Then, weeks after accepting a quarter-million-dollar campaign contribution from the hospital's chairman, Greg Abbott got involved, using his office to go to court -- against the victims."" Abbott solicited and accepted the donation, we confirmed, and the state intervened in lawsuits pitting patients against the hospital, though he got involved to defend a state law. Senator’s backup By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said Davis based her claim in part on a July 30, 2014, news story in the Dallas Morning News stating that not long after the chairman of the board of the Baylor Health Care System, which owns the Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano, donated $250,000 to Abbott’s campaign, Abbott weighed in on federal lawsuits against the hospital where a neurosurgeon allegedly had done damage to patients. News report and interview of donor We confirmed from Abbott’s campaign finance filings with the state and an interview with the board chairman and donor, Temple businessman Drayton McLane, that McLane donated $250,000 to Abbott’s campaign in January 2014. That donation, the News story said, came after McLane gave the campaign $100,000 in 2013. Before the six-figure contributions, the story said, McLane’s biggest donation to Abbott had been $25,000. Abbott’s campaign recorded the $250,000 donation as arriving Jan. 23, 2014 -- the very date one of the relevant federal lawsuits were filed against the hospital. Then again, we realized with a nudge from Petkanas after this article initially appeared, one of the several lawsuits was filed Dec. 27, 2013, weeks prior to McLane's contribution. His $250,000 check, a photo of which McLane’s office emailed to us, was dated Jan. 21, 2014. The News story said Abbott and McLane had each told the paper the two had not discussed the lawsuits. McLane also said he didn’t know about the case before contributing the $250,000, the paper said, and he stressed he had no personal financial interest in the nonprofit hospital system; the chairman’s post is unpaid. By phone, McLane told us he’s known Abbott since before Abbott, originally a Houston lawyer, won election as a Harris County state district judge in 1992 and gave the $250,000 after Abbott asked him for a large contribution. McLane said he hadn’t spoken with the Republican nominee since. Asked what he expected for the eye-catching contribution, McLane said: ""I’m not expecting to get anything back. I believe in strong good government. Unfortunately, on both sides, there are heavy contributions."" On top of not knowing about the lawsuits described by Davis before making his donation, McLane said, he hadn’t long been chairman of Baylor Scott & White Health, which owns the Plano facility, having become chairman when healthcare systems merged in October 2013; McLane previously chaired Scott & White Healthcare. Abbott in court As noted in the News, the federal suits against the Baylor system and Plano hospital challenge the constitutionality of a state law requiring the plaintiffs to prove Baylor acted with actual intent to harm patients -- which the suing plaintiffs/families call an impossibly stiff burden. Petkanas of Davis’ campaign provided copies of several lawsuits filed on behalf of patients and families, each one alleging a neurosurgeon, Christopher Duntsch, was permitted by the Plano hospital to perform surgeries under the influence of illegal drugs and alcohol, causing harm. Those suits also challenge action by state lawmakers in 2003, while overhauling laws regulating lawsuits seeking damages,  to delete a definition of ""malice"" in the law, hence ""eliminating a common-law right arbitrarily in light of the purposes of the statute leaving only an impossible condition before liability will attach,"" the lawsuits say. A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, Lauren Bean, emailed us the state’s nearly identical March 24, 2014, filings in three plaintiff challenges to the law. In the filings, the state said it has a statutory right to intervene in a case when the constitutionality of a state law is at issue. On March 31, 2014, a week after the state filed its request, U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis granted the request to intervene ""for the purpose of defending the constitutionality of Texas law,"" Solis wrote. His order said no parties to the litigation objected. It’s undisputed an attorney general may seek to get involved in a federal suit to defend a state law, but some lawyers told us it’s up to the official to do so -- or not. Attorney Kay Van Wey, who represents some plaintiffs in the suits against the hospital, said by email Abbott’s move was unusual and unreasonable, though she didn’t object, she said, because there is no legal way to do so; we didn’t divine what she meant by that. Van Wey further said Abbott ""is defending a law that essentially gives immunity to hospitals for credentialing dangerous physicians. The law, as it now stands, denies access to the courts for good, taxpaying Texas citizens, who through no fault of their own, were butchered by a highly dangerous surgeon.

The state does not condone, support or defend the actions of the hospital or doctor. The only thing the state will argue is that the law is not unconstitutional.""

Michael Hull emailed: ""The AG intervention is consistent with federal and state law. The AG is defending the constitutionality of a statute. His office has not taken a position on the facts alleged in the petition nor has the AG chosen to defend the hospital or the doctor."" Hull later said such constitutional challenges are rare, ""but when challenges do occur, it is common for the AG to defend the constitutionality of the statute."" Hull and Michael Guajardo, the Dallas president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, each pointed out any litigant is required to notify the state of a federal challenge to a state law’s constitutionality We asked if that formal notice touched off Abbott’s intervention. Not so, Bean said, adding the attorney general’s office has no record of receiving the notice, which court filings say was sent by certified mail. Instead, Bean said, Jonathan Mitchell, the state solicitor general, learned of the suits from a March 10, 2014, news story in the Texas Lawyer magazine.

","A TV commercial for Allan Fung says that Gina Raimondo paid $70 million in taxpayer money to cover fees to hedge fund managers.

But a raft of other Journal stories do give the exact figure -- about $45 million -- as does the website for the General Treasurer’s office. Fung’s campaign now insists that the figure they quoted is not just for fiscal 2013. They’re also assuming an equal amount or more will be paid in fiscal 2014. The commercial doesn’t say that, but that may be reasonable over the longer haul. If the 2014 fees are as much as they were in 2013, the two-year total would easily reach $70 million. (And even though the Fung campaign didn’t mention it, let’s not forget the $16 million paid in hedge fund fees in fiscal 2012.) But by citing only a 2013 Journal story, the ad implies that the fees were paid only in 2013. Finally, the commercial’s claim that Raimondo herself paid taxpayer money to hedge fund managers is misleading at best. Raimondo has recommended increasing hedge fund investments, but she is not solely responsible for how the state invests its pension fund.

He is also the former chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. He was an unsuccessful Wisconsin state Senate candidate in 2004. He is a Kenosha, Wis., native and lawyer.
","*Earliest polling data was March 2013 So, while Priebus makes the case that the GOP has a handful of candidates well suited to take on a diminishing Clinton brand, actually, despite a drop in favorability, she continues to do relatively well against the Republicans he mentioned. She would beat all four we looked at if the election were held today, and has only seen her lead shrink slightly against Bush and Ryan. (It’s gone up against Christie and Paul.) Our ruling Priebus said Clinton ""went from a 70-percent approval rating"" down to ""about 52"" in 18 months. Her favorability dropped 18 points in one poll from Bloomberg during that time. But Bloomberg’s poll from December 2012 had Clinton’s favorability 12 points higher than the average poll taken around the same period.

More important, a balance sheet does not tell the full story and the experts we reached said the Clintons’ earning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on. A few weeks before they left the White House, the Clintons were able to muster a cash down payment of $855,000 and secure a $1.995 million mortgage.

","In a fundraising letter, Angel Taveras said he turned ""a $110 million deficit into a $1.6 million surplus for our city."" The average reader would get the impression that the city was $110 million in debt but now has an extra $1.6 million. The threat of a $110 million deficit was real, but the city's actual debt never accumulated to anything close to that amount. To their credit, Taveras, his staff and the city's unions engineered a major turnaround in the city's finances that prevented that from happening. The $1.6 million surplus was also real, but only for that year. And by then the city was so deep in debt, its general fund was still $9.8 million in the hole. And if the city hits its target this year, it will still be roughly $8.8 million in the red when the fiscal year ends June 30. Although Taveras accurately characterized the potential deficit in his budget speech, the campaign letter that initially caught our attention gives the false impression that (a.) the city was $110 million in debt when it wasn't and (b.) it's not in debt anymore, which it is. The campaign fundraising letter oversimplifies and overreaches to the point of being deceptive. ",C.

","Brown said he is ""ninth generation from New Hampshire."" For the most part, this is true: Brown’s New Hampshire lineage connects his grandmother to some of the region’s earliest European inhabitants. In fact, one of Brown’s ancestors, Francis Mathews, came to the New World in 1634 specifically to help settle the territory that became New Hampshire. But this isn’t the only relevant fact to consider. Brown’s statement can also be interpreted to mean that Brown counts himself as part of an unbroken line of ancestors who are ""from"" New Hampshire. It’s clear that Brown and his mother spent much of their lives in Massachusetts. The family connection to New Hampshire weakened after the birth of Brown’s grandmother, Bertha Rugg, who moved to Massachusetts and raised her daughter -- Brown’s mother -- in the Bay State. Brown himself stated in a press release sent this week that ""I have lived in Massachusetts for most of my life,"" and his trademark pickup truck parked outside a GOP fundraiser in Nashua on Dec. 19 still had Massachusetts license plates.

West represented Florida's 22nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013. Lieutenant Colonel West retired from the Army in 2004 after 22 years of service.","Our experts also said that it's plausible that West would still have a Secret clearance today. Since retired officers can be called back to duty, and because many of them do consulting work for the military or for companies that work with the military, it's common for retired officers to maintain a security clearance. But what about him having ""a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain""? We see at least two ways to look at this claim. The first is that West is saying that he had a higher security clearance than someone occupying the office of president of the United States. Even if you assume that he was referring to the period in which West held a TS/SCI, our experts say he's wrong. ""The president is the one who established the security clearance system by executive order,"" said Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists. ""Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information."" John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. ""This is a silly statement,"" Pike said. ""The only clearance the president needs is the mandate of the people."" The statement is even more questionable if West was actually referring to what he says is his current clearance -- Secret. ""A Secret security clearance is the most commonly held security clearance,"" Aftergood said. ""Almost anyone without a criminal record or serious financial difficulties can get such a clearance if their employment requires it."" There's one more possible interpretation, and when we reached the West campaign, they said this is indeed what the candidate meant at the forum. As a career military officer, West went through a rigorous screening and investigatory process in order to receive his TS/SCI clearance. President Barack Obama got his authority by virtue of a popular vote. There is no security process required before one becomes president. If, in theory, Obama was not president and decided to apply for a security clearance, there's no guarantee he'd qualify for one. He'd have to go through a painstaking process, and investigators may raise any number of questions. ""The fact that (Obama) admitted to cocaine use, travel to unauthorized countries years before, and his associations with (black nationalist) Louis Farrakhan and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, he probably would not have been granted a security clearance,"" said Josh Grodin, West's campaign manager. This argument does at least have a grain of validity to it.

Bill White,Says Gov. Rick Perry is “by far and away the highest-paid state employee on an hourly basis.”,"Bill White, an author, is a San Antonio native who was mayor of Houston from 2004-2009. He was the 2010 Democratic nominee for governor of Texas.
","
White’s campaign cited Perry’s public schedule for January through May and its calculation that Perry accumulated 145.5 hours of scheduled events in the period. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in an e-mail: “We followed (Perry’s) state schedule and counted 1 hour for events, 1/2 hour for phone calls, 1/2 hour for press conferences. Most busy CEOs get in and out and get things done. Church was not counted.” 
Bacon added that she’s heard Mack Brown, head coach of the University of Texas football team, is the highest-paid state employee, “but you can bet he works a lot more than seven hours a week.”
 
We’re not testing Brown’s work ethic, but we’re game for White’s charge, which his campaign based on dividing five months’ of Perry’s $150,000 annual salary—about $62,500—by 146 (rounding up from 145.5 hours of state-scheduled events as listed on his schedule), resulting in an “hourly” pay rate of about $428. 
Made sense for Bacon to mention the UT coach, who’s widely known for having the top salary among state workers, at $5.1 million. Presuming a 40-hour work week, Brown’s hourly rate breaks out to nearly $2,452. Presuming a 60-hour week--head football coaches work notoriously long hours--Brown’s hourly rate drops to nearly $1,635. If Brown improbably worked around the clock, his hourly rate would be $582, still more than the hourly rate White calculates for Perry. 
Another UT coach and the head football coaches at Texas A&M University and Texas Tech University each make $1.5 million or more, as noted in a 2010 chart compiled by the online Texas Tribune listing the highest-paid state workers. Assuming each works 60 hours a week, their salaries translate to hourly rates of $481 or more. 
Then again, the argument is often made that college coaches like Brown, whose salary derives from sports revenues, are in a special category. What about other state employees? 
Separately, we asked the state comptroller’s office to break out the state’s highest-paid workers, including Perry. The agency, citing salary figures as of April, generated a list taking into account about 157,000 state workers, excluding college and university employees, which it does not track. 
The compilation suggests Perry’s annual salary is less than what the state pays 313 other workers, topped by Britt Harris, chief investment officer of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, at $480,000. We called the system and inquired into how many hours Harris works. Spokesman Howard Goldman said “well over 40” hours a week. Assuming Harris works an average of 60 hours weekly, his hourly rate runs about $154. If he’s averaging 50 hours a week, the rate would be about $185. 
Perry’s hourly wage is more than double those amounts, per White’s calculation of his working hours based on events posted on his official schedule. This begs the question: Is the schedule an accurate indicator of how much time Perry spends on the job? 
That’s a toughie because the schedule is far from complete, making it hard for anyone to gauge how the governor spends his time. In 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reviewed the calendars for the state’s top six statewide elected officials covering January through March of that year. The newspaper said that while the officials’ calendars “did not prove to be comprehensive accountings of their working hours, they yielded glimpses of how the officials spent their time.” 
Perry had state-related events on fewer than 40 days during the period, the newspaper reported, counting a parade, a coach's salute and two Washington dinners--and he had no state-scheduled events on 31 weekdays.  
A Perry spokesman at the time, Robert Black, was quoted noting that Perry had just assumed the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association and started promoting his book saluting the Boy Scouts. “Both these events took up a considerable amount of the governor's time,” Black said, “but working hard to elect more conservative governors across the nation and espousing the values and virtues of the Boy Scouts of America is well worth the effort.”  
Of late, Bacon told us in an e-mail, it’s up to Perry to prove he’s been busy with state business in the many hours he did not have scheduled events. She said: “When you're a CEO, you can't have last-minute meetings. Things have to be planned in advance.” 
We didn’t hear back from Perry’s campaign or his state office. But we came across this reaction to the White campaign calculation from Perry, as reported by Hearst Newspapers columnist Peggy Fikac: “If they've made anybody that can outwork me yet, please introduce me to him or her. Texans know I am mobile, I am agile, and I'm going to continue doing work for 'em 24/7. Just because it doesn't show up on my schedule doesn't mean I'm not out working for the people of the state of Texas, thank you very much."" 
Bacon spotted the same Perry reaction, which she termed “truly priceless” in an e-mail. “He is ‘mobile’ and ‘agile?’ What does that have to do with working seven hours a week while drawing a full-time salary? Sounds more like something related to jogging ... and shooting coyotes,” wrote Bacon -- a reference to Perry’s declaration this year that he shot a coyote while jogging. 
Seeking historical perspective, we called chiefs of staff to the governors preceding Perry, George W. Bush and Ann Richards. 
Joe M. Allbaugh, who was Gov. Bush’s chief of staff,  said Bush’s official schedule didn’t reflect his work days, which often ran from early in the morning into evenings, especially if lawmakers were in session. “This is foolish and hogwash for the White campaign to draw this type of comparison,” Allbaugh said. “All public officials put in more hours than they’re paid. It doesn’t matter if you’re Democratic, Republican or Martian, your public service is not for the money.” 
We asked Allbaugh, who backs Perry’s re-election, if it’s possible Perry enjoys a lot of down time. Allbaugh replied: “I don’t know if it’s possible to do that or not. People need to remember, that person is governor full time... Hurricanes, oil spills, they don’t call up (from) 8 to 5 (saying:) ‘By the way, is the governor in?’” 
Next, we reached Austin lobbyist John Fainter, who was a chief of staff for Richards when she was governor and earlier served as secretary of state with Gov. Mark White. Fainter, who has contributed to Perry's campaign kitty, said governors don’t ever get away from work. “Things come up,” Fainter said. “The schedule is largely irrelevant as to the time they actually spend on duties.” 
We get it: Texas governors don’t punch time clocks.  
Where does that leave White’s statement that Perry is “far and away” the highest-paid state worker on an hourly basis? 
For starters, Perry’s hourly wage as calculated by White is less than what we calculated for several state employees (coaches).  
Most importantly, he assumes the public schedule released by Perry’s office accounts for all his working hours. But according to the Statesman’s previous reporting as well as two veterans of the governor’s office, such schedules are woefully incomplete. 
White could have sought a better accounting of how the governor spends his time without cobbling together comparisons that don’t hold up. ",W. Gardner Selby,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/jul/12/bill-white/white-citing-available-schedule-says-perry-far-and/,pants-fire
Alexi Giannoulias,"""He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.""","
Alexi Giannoulias is the former state treasurer of Illinois. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010 as the Democratic nominee for the seat formerly held by President Barack Obama, but was narrowly defeated by then-Rep. Mark Kirk.","""He did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.""This was an issue first brought to light by blogger Terry Welch, who posted a Dec. 18, 2009, memo from Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Gail McGinn approving an exception to allow Kirk to train in Afghanistan. The memo contained this intriguing concluding paragraph:""As a candidate for the vacant Senate seat in Illinois, Commander Kirk must complete the appropriate acknowledgment of limitations required for all candidates on active duty. ... Ordinarily this acknowledgment must be completed within 15 days of entering active duty. Because of the short period of active duty and concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty, Commander Kirk must complete this form prior to his entry on active duty."" Kirk campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski released a statement: ""Mark Kirk has served our nation in the U.S. Navy for two decades and has done so honorably. The fact is, Congressman Kirk never violated Defense Department policies. He has misspoken about his record, acknowledged it and apologized. Mark Kirk left for Afghanistan and he did not engage in political activities -- even in the face of radio commercials accusing him of being gay. The memorandum in question is simply off the mark. Furthermore, this raises grave concerns and questions about who gained access to Kirk's confidential records. The document in question should be viewed for what it is -- a baseless political ploy by partisans bent on defending a U.S. Senate seat at any cost."" The Pentagon, however, later clarified, saying that on two occasions, Kirk was ""counseled"" about violating military policy regarding getting involved in politics while on active duty, and that Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again, the AP reported. Specifically, the Pentagon said Kirk gave video interviews in late 2008 about Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich being arrested. And in July 2009, Kirk or a staff member wrote on the candidate's Twitter account that he was on duty at the Pentagon's National Military Command Center. According to a Department of Defense directive on political activities by members of the Armed Forces: ""In keeping with the traditional concept that members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and that members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement."" Specifically, the rules say that ""a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall not ... participate in any radio, television, or other program or group discussion as an advocate for or against a partisan political party, candidate, or cause."" According to AP coverage of a Kirk press conference published on June 30, 2010, ""As Kirk apologized (for some of his misstatements about his military record), however, he also acknowledged something his campaign had flatly denied just two weeks ago — that he was twice scolded by the Pentagon for improperly mingling politics with his military duties."" He stopped short of acknowledging that he had actually violated military policy, though. The Giannoulias ad states, ""He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service."" The Pentagon released a statement to AP saying that Kirk was twice ""counseled"" for mixing politics with military service. And we have a memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense referring to ""concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty.""

In an interview for Yahoo News in January, Mike Allen, chief political correspondent for

Politico

, a Washington-based newspaper, asked several Republican candidates at the time whether they prefer a Mac or a PC.
 
""Neither,"" McCain replied. ""I am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that I can get.""
 
In a July 11 interview with the

New York Times,

McCain hardly sounded like he has since gone techie.
 
In answer to a question about what Web sites he looks at regularly, McCain said aides ""show me"" the Drudge Report, Politico.com and sometimes Real Clear Politics. He also noted that he reads the blog written by his daughter, Meagan.
 
""But do you go online for yourself?"" McCain was asked.
 
""They go on for me,"" McCain said. ""I am learning to get online myself, and I will have that down fairly soon, getting on myself. I don't expect to be a great communicator, I don't expect to set up my own blog, but I am becoming computer literate to the point where I can get the information that I need — including going to my daughter's blog first, before anything else.""
 
""Do you use a blackberry or e-mail?""
 
""No,"" McCain said, but then explained. ""I use the Blackberry, but I don't e-mail, I've never felt the particular need to e-mail. I read e-mails all the time, but the communications that I have with my friends and staff are oral and done with my cell phone. I have the luxury of being in contact with them literally all the time. We now have a phone on the plane that is usable on the plane, so I just never really felt a need to do it. But I do — could I just say, really — I understand the impact of blogs on American politics today and political campaigns. I understand that. And I understand that something appears on one blog, can ricochet all around and get into the evening news, the front page of the

New York Times.

So, I do pay attention to the blogs. And I am not in any way unappreciative of the impact that they have on entire campaigns and world opinion.""
 
Although McCain has never blamed injuries suffered as a Vietnam POW for his lack of computer skills, articles in the Boston Globe and Forbes in 2000 noted that those injuries make it difficult for him to use a keyboard.
 
According to Forbes: ""McCain is an inveterate devotee of email. His nightly ritual is to read his email together with his wife, Cindy. The injuries he incurred as a Vietnam POW make it painful for McCain to type. Instead, he dictates responses that his wife types on a laptop. 'She's a whiz on the keyboard, and I'm so laborious,' McCain admits.""
 
Still, McCain admits that he just isn't much of a technology user.
 
Two years ago, McCain told CNN, ""I read my e-mails, but I don't write any. I'm a Neanderthal--I don't even type. I do have rudimentary capabilities to call up some websites, like the New York Times online, that sort of stuff. No laptop. No PalmPilot. I prefer my schedule on notecards, which I keep in my jacket pocket.""
 
The Obama campaign ad says McCain ""can't send an e-mail."" That seems to paint McCain as a bit more out of touch than he is. He does own a Blackberry and he says he regularly gets and reads e-mails. McCain admits he doesn't send them, but never said he can't.

Scott Walker,"""From 2010-2014, median household income"" in Wisconsin ""has actually gone up 7.4 percent.""
 ","Scott Walker, a Republican, is the former governor of Wisconsin. He was first elected in November 2010. He survived a recall election in 2012, defeating Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett after igniting controversy with a bill curtailing public-employee union collective-bargaining rights.  He won re-election to a four-year term in November 2014 and was a 2016 presidential candidate before dropping out in September of 2015. He was defeated by Tony Evers in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Walker is a former Milwaukee County executive and former member of the state Assembly.","Walker had cited U.S. Census data, usually a gold-standard source. But the data was from the census’ Current Population Survey. That set is good for the national income picture, but less accurate at the state level. The better data is from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, a rolling collection of household and demographic statistics from 3.5 million addresses. Those figures revealed a much different picture than Walker had painted: An income drop nationally, yes -- of 1.72 percent. But also an income drop -- not an increase, as Walker stated -- in Wisconsin of 1.62 percent. So, what about the governor’s claim this time? The news story The Journal Sentinel’s article reported on newly released data from the American Community Survey covering two periods: 2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2014. Median household income fell by a significant margin in two-thirds of Wisconsin counties during the period. Importantly, the article reported figures that are adjusted for inflation. By the way, think of median household income as the midpoint: Half of Wisconsin households have an income higher than the median, and half have an income that is lower. Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick emailed the Journal Sentinel about the article, saying it was distorted because it did not include the 7.4 percent figure Walker cited in his tweet. The Journal Sentinel asked her for the data that produced that figure. What the newspaper found was that Walker used American Community Survey data -- but didn’t properly adjust for inflation. That means he compared 2010 dollars to 2014 dollars, an economic no-no. Whenever you are looking at income, ""you should be looking at real income instead of nominal income, which means you adjust for changes,"" said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University in Milwaukee and former chief economist of the United Nations Economic Commission in Europe. Otherwise, he said, you’re looking at apples and oranges. ""$100 today is not the same as $100 last year,"" Chowdhury said. ""If you adjust for price, what you get is the real change in your buying power."" For the news article and for this analysis, the Journal Sentinel used the Consumer Price Index from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust for inflation. Here’s what the adjusted data show: Walker’s method: ""What you are doing is the right approach, looking at real income instead of nominal income,"" Chowdhury said.

Under Trump, the number of migrant children temporarily housed near the Mexico border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection peaked at 2,600, in June 2019. Under Biden, the figure as of April 5, the date of Tatum’s post, was 4,231. We found that 2019 was the last year border authorities recorded a surge in migrant children and family crossings. In 2020, the Trump administration stopped taking minors into custody after it implemented a policy that immediately expelled all people crossing the border, including children, citing COVID-19 precautions. The Biden administration suspended that policy for children in January, and now allows children who cross the border alone to remain in the U.S. while they await immigration court proceedings.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed to us that the 2,600 unaccompanied minors in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody in June 2019 was the highest such figure under Trump.  The number was 5,160, essentially twice as many as at the peak under Trump, when Abbott made his claim. So, as of April 5, the date of Tatum’s Facebook post, had that figure more than doubled to 12,000?  No. According to the latest unaccompanied children daily reports provided to us by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the figure dropped. It was 4,231 on April 5 and 4,228 on April 6.  Those figures count children housed temporarily by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Federal policy is to move those children into more permanent facilities run by Department of Health and Human Services facilities within 72 hours. As of April 6, there were 16,045 children in HHS facilities. According to HHS, its more than 100 shelters in 17 states, run by state-certified nonprofit agencies, provide services on ""par with facilities in the child welfare system that house American children."" Besides getting the numbers on the border wrong, T the framing of the post comparing Trump and Biden is missing context.  Much of the uproar over Trump’s confinement of migrant children was because his policy was to separate families after they crossed the border — adults went to one place to await criminal charges, while their children were sent to another facility. That zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings was in place from April to June of 2018; it is not in place now.  Tatum claimed: ""Kids at the border: 2,600 highest number Trump, 12,000 currently under Biden.""

Paul Ryan,"""Obamacare has failed.""","U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R.-Wis., became Speaker of the House in 2015 and served until his retirement in January 2019. Ryan was elected to represent southern Wisconsin in Congress in 1998 and for part of his tenure chaired the House Budget Committee. He was Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate in the 2012 presidential election. He did not seek re-election in 2018.","But perhaps no Ryan attack on the law has been as audacious as ""Obamacare has failed,"" a declaration he has made several times. He even went so far as to say on Jan. 27, 2017 that it is ""basically a spectacular failure,"" though three days later he went softer, saying in a tweet: ""For many Americans, it has already failed."" So, let’s put Ryan’s claim to the test. There are many ways, of course, to evaluate the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010 though many changes were phased in later. But two of the major ones are coverage (Do more people have health insurance?) and costs (How much do you pay for insurance and what does it cover?) ""There were things that succeeded and there things that didn't go as planned,"" said Donna Friedsam, health policy programs director at the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Said economist Gail Wilensky, a senior health and welfare adviser to Republican President George H.W. Bush: ""To say it’s a failure is problematic because it requires a more nuanced answer."" This table highlights some of our findings. It’s followed by a more detailed analysis. The coverage More gained coverage: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that during the first six years of Obamacare, 20 million Americans gained health insurance as a result of the law -- a figure acknowledged by Donald Trump’s administration. Similarly, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected in January 2017 that a 2015 bill that would have repealed key portions of the law would have increased the number of uninsured by 18 million in one year. On a related note, the President’s Council of Economic Advisers credits the law for what it says is a one-third drop nationally since 2010 in the share of Americans reporting that they have forgone medical care due to cost. Ryan said: ""Obamacare has failed."" The Affordable Care Act did not meet all its promises, including a big one -- that you could keep your insurance plan if you liked it. But health care costs have risen more slowly since the law took effect and the law has met its major goal of getting more people insured -- an estimated 20 million. That’s not a failure. The biggest problem with Ryan’s statement is that he, and Obamacare critics, take a nuanced situation and turn it into a black-and-white statement. The same problem would face those who say Obamacare is a great success.

All gun deaths are violent, but Speier’s statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speier’s claim might also lead some to think she’s talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting.

","Stimpson wrote ""BILL HOWELL is allied to group pushing MIXED SEX BATHROOMS in Stafford schools."" Equality Virginia unsuccessfully advocated allowing transgender students in Stafford to use the restrooms of their choice. Stimpson’s statement makes it sound like the LGBT group wanted a broad policy that would have allowed all students of either sex to use the same bathrooms. That’s not the case. When proposed, the debate focused on one fourth-grader at one school. The connection between Equality Virginia and Howell is equally tenuous. The group made annual donations totaling $6,000 to Howell’s multi-million dollar PAC from 2006 to 2012. What Stimpson omits is that Equality Virginia has not contributed to the PAC in more than two years. The group decided, well in advance of restroom issue, that Howell was unfriendly to LGBT issues and now says Howell ""has not done anything to assist"" it. So any small comity that once may have existed between the speaker and Equality Virginia is certainly dead.

The White House estimate assumes that local Head Start organizations will respond to funding cuts by reducing slots, but that isn’t the only option. Many organizations are exploring different options, such as fundraising and reducing hours. 
Warner’s statement contains an element of truth in that some children already have lost Head Starts slots and others have less access to the program. But by and large, he assumes that a worst-case scenario for Head Start has already taken place.

HHS hopes to provide data in June that will show how many spots for Head Start are actually being cut based on reporting by the programs. Until federal officials share that data, it is difficult to come up with an accurate nationwide number based on anecdotal evidence in news articles. 
Also, Castor used a vague term by saying the children will lose ""access."" Access could mean a number of things, from scaling back weeks of operation, removing bus service, or cutting enrolled kids.

Jerry Patterson,"“We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.”","Jerry Patterson, who won election to three terms as state land commissioner starting in 2002, filed to seek the post afresh in the 2018 elections. The former state senator from Pasadena unsuccessfully sought the 2014 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor.
","Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking a third term this November, refers to the the state’s oil-soaked history in a recent column extolling renewable energy. In his article, published Tuesday in the Austin American-Statesman, Patterson writes: “We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.” Even though oil production has been declining, state revenue from oil and gas is the tops? When we sought background, the General Land Office shared a chart showing state oil and gas income reached a historical high of $495 million in 1982 that wasn't exceeded until 2008, when it hit $533 million. The state's oil-and-gas-related proceeds dropped to $381 million in 2009, the land office says. Counting revenue during the first seven months of this fiscal year, we calculate it will reach $279 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year Aug. 31. Total state take during Patterson's seven-plus years as commissioner: $2.7 billion. And when did oil production peak? According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which tracks in-state oil production, the peak year for crude oil production was 1972 when more than 167,000 wells produced nearly 1.3 billion barrels. As of 2007, production had ebbed to about 336 million barrels. In 2008, production increased for the first time since 1991 to more than 346 million barrels, before falling in 2009, according to the commission. R.J. DeSilva, spokesperson for the State Comptroller's office, offered this analysis for the surge in state income from oil and gas surged well after oil production peaked: ""Oil and natural gas production are taxed on the value of oil and natural gas that’s produced. Oil and natural gas prices were higher in the early ‘80s than in the ‘70s (and reached all time highs in 2008)."" So how does Patterson’s statement shake out? He gets the peak-production timing right; it was the '70s. But he's off in saying state government is making more than ever from oil and gas ""right now."" That was true for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2008, but in 2009 state oil and gas revenue fell 29 percent from the year before and it's on pace to register another decline this fiscal year.

Ron Johnson,"Says Barack Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal ""would go directly to terrorism.""","Ron Johnson is a Republican U.S. senator from Wisconsin. A businessman and accountant, Johnson defeated Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold in the 2010 election. He is seeking re-election in 2016.","But the target of the latest political missiles are Feingold, the Democrat who lost the Wisconsin Senate seat to Johnson, the Republican incumbent, in 2010. One of the attacks, which also targets President Barack Obama, was made by Johnson on Jan. 22, 2016. A Johnson campaign email, signed by a campaign staffer, starts this way, with a reference to a statement from the day before: Hey all, In light of the Obama administration admitting Thursday that money from its reckless Iran deal would go directly to terrorism, below are five crucial moments in Senator Feingold’s blind support for the deal. Johnson’s assertion -- that the administration has admitted that money from the Iran nuclear deal would go directly to terrorism -- doesn’t come out of thin air. But is it air tight? Iran nuclear deal The Iran deal was made with the United States, China and three other world powers. Iran, which was within three months of getting a nuclear bomb, committed to not pursue nuclear weapons. The deal contains other elements, but a key one is that all of the European Union and most American sanctions against Iran were lifted. Critics say that effectively amounts to a $150 billion check (though some say it’s more like $100 billion) to Iran -- a reference to the amount of Iran’s assets frozen in foreign banks. The Washington Post reported that Iran has more than $100 billion in available frozen assets — most of it in banks in China, Japan and South Korea — but that slightly less than half will more or less automatically go to preexisting debts. ""How the rest is spent will reveal the direction of internal power struggles between Iranian hard-liners and pragmatists,"" the article said. John Kerry To back the claim about the Obama administration and funds going directly to terrorism, the Johnson campaign email links to a January 2016 news article in The Hill about comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry. Kerry had told CNBC’s ""Squawk Box"" that Iran would get only $55 billion of the $150 billion referenced, saying the rest is committed to China and other countries: I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. To some degree, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented. But I can tell you this: Right now, we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. I’m sure at some point, some of it will. To be clear, Iran is one of only three countries (Sudan and Syria are the others) that the U.S. State Department has designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.   The IRGC, as Iran’s premier security institution, fields an army, navy and air force and ""presides over a vast power structure with influence over almost every aspect of Iranian life,"" according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC’s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations. So, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately will end up with organizations involved in terrorism. But that’s not the same as funds going directly to terrorism, as Johnson claimed. Kerry did tell reporters the same day, according to the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is ""already complaining that they are not getting the money."" But Kerry also said the Obama administration believes the amount of money that might flow to terrorist groups will be limited because ""the demands of Iran and of the Rouhani administration and of the supreme leader for development in their country are such that there is no way they can succeed in doing what they want to do if they are very busy funding a lot of terrorism and if they are putting money into that kind of enterprise and not into things they need to do to fund their economy."" It’s worth noting that Kerry’s comments weren’t the first of their kind. Johnson’s campaign cited to us statements made in August 2015 by senior administration officials to a U.S. Senate committee. The officials said, according to U.S. News & World Report, they were ""nearly certain"" Iran would continue funding terrorism with the tens of billions of dollars it stands to gain from the nuclear deal. The White House did not respond to our requests for comment. Our rating Johnson said Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal ""would go directly to terrorism."" Administration officials have said they expect some portion of money from the deal with Iran, which is aimed at preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, will end up with groups that are labeled as terrorists. Johnson said Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal ""would go directly to terrorism.""

To follow-up queries, Alvarado sent a chart listing 24 vacancies at that time for positions paying $100,000 or more. So, you could say the city had 903 positions paying six figures at the time Wiley spoke. Alvarado said the city then had 11,852 workers, which means its $100,000-plus earners accounted for 7 percent of its workers. Plus, more workers were heading into the six-figure class shortly. To our inquiry, Alvarado said 3.5 percent raises taking effect Sept. 21, 2014, (before the start of the new fiscal year in October) would result in 1,162 employees earning $100,000 or more. At that time, she said, the city expected there to be another 36 open positions paying more than $100,000 each. So at that time, the city projects, 1,198 positions will pay six figures.

","Has Stoney flip-flopped on not raising taxes? Stoney had a nuanced answer almost every time he was asked about increases when he ran for mayor and during his first year in office.

For the most part, Stoney remained consistent. He took several steps to streamline services and improve revenue collections before proposing increases in the meals tax last year and the real estate tax this year.

During the ""lightning round"" of a mayoral debate three weeks before the 2016 election, candidates were asked to state in five words or less whether they would raise taxes.

Bike Austin,"""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets.""","Bike Austin, an advocacy group, says its mission is to ""improves quality of life for all of Austin and Central Texas by growing bicycling as a form of transportation, exercise, and recreation.""
","After a 14-year-old bicyclist was hit by a car and killed in Austin in June 2016, local nonprofit Bike Austin called on the city to make streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. In a statement, the group’s executive director, Mercedes Feris, said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Does that hold up? Group cites city report To our inquiry, Feris cited a 2015 City of Austin report, ""Redesigning the Street: A Report on Right-Sizing Projects in Austin, TX 1999-2014,"" analyzing the effects of a certain kind of project, called a road diet, designed to make streets safer by shrinking opportunities to drive too fast. In what the Federal Highway Administration calls the classic example of a road diet, lane lines on a four-lane road that has two lanes in each direction are repainted to create a three-lane road, leaving a single lane in each direction and a center lane solely for left turns. A 2014 agency guide to road diets says the concept developed decades ago in response to the expansion-minded road construction of the 1950s and 1960s, when two-lane roads were frequently upgraded to four lanes. One of the first road diets, the guide says, was applied in 1979 to a four-lane road in Billings, Montana. On that road, where about 10,000 cars drove every day, the shrinkage to three lanes was found to reduce crashes without increasing delays. We dug into Austin’s more recent report and checked with experts on road diets and bicycle transportation. From that, we found that such projects often incorporate new bike lanes -- but they don’t typically add sidewalks. Generally, too, the highway administration has found that crashes in which a car hits a pedestrian walking on the side of the road consistently fall by more than 50 percent when sidewalks are installed. We failed to identify research tying the addition of simple, striped bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. The cited city report covers 37 local road diets completed from 1999 through 2014, including the one that Feris pointed out, on a 1.6-mile stretch of Manor Road in Northeast Austin. It resulted, the report says, in a 38 percent drop in crashes. A city spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, responded to our inquiry about the research, saying by email the 38 percent reduction in any kind of crash ties to nearly six years of data collected by the Austin Police Department before and after the road diet took place on the stretch of Manor Road between Theo Drive and East 51st Street in November 2010.  A close-up aerial view from along the noted 1.6-mile segment of Manor Road after the road diet was completed. The road includes bike lanes and the hallmark of a road diet project: a center two-way left-turn lane. SOURCE: Google Earth. Monroy told us that in the three years before the project, from November 2007 through October 2010, the to-be-reconfigured section had 39 crashes involving any combination of motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians--adding up to one pedestrian death and 16 injury crashes involving motor vehicles. In the three years after the project, from December 2010 through November 2013, she said, the stretch had 24 crashes -- or 38.5 percent fewer -- with no fatalities and 14 injury crashes, one involving a pedestrian, two affecting bicyclists. It’s also worth mentioning, as the city report says, that bike traffic on the segment increased 180 percent, from 54 bikes tallied in a 24-hour period before the project (and its bike lanes) was completed with 151 bikes in a similar period after. The full report presents general crash-reduction analyses for five of the 37 projects. Among the five, it sums up, ""right-sizing projects,"" or road diets, contributed to at least 22 percent fewer crashes, on Amherst Drive, up to the nearly 39 percent reduction on the Manor Road stretch. We calculated the average of the five: 28.8 percent fewer crashes. Expert: Road diets reduce accidents For outside perspective, we reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, hearing back about road diets, bike lanes and sidewalks from Joan Hudson, an associate research engineer. Hudson advised that the noted 38 percent reduction in crashes falls in line with national research she’s reviewed, also pointing us to the highway administration and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program -- a division of the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Each agency highlights the same two studies finding ""the road-diet treatment had a significant effect"" in reducing crashes, as the cooperative research program said in a 2008 report. The reductions ranged from 19 to 47 percent, with an average of 29 percent. Hudson said road diets make roads safer for a few reasons: additional space improves reaction time, and a narrower roadway tends to reduce how fast drivers go, making crashes less severe. Road diets also make bicyclists more comfortable, she said, because they have dedicated space instead of sharing lanes with cars. The city’s report also reflected these points. Hudson confirmed that most road diets include bike lanes, but said sidewalks -- posing greater costs than what it takes to revise lane lines -- are hardly ever included. (It looks to us like a sidewalk may have been installed on the Manor Road stretch. To our query, Monroy said she couldn’t confirm it was part of the related road-diet project.) And by phone, Hudson told us that determining how much road diets reduce crashes involving bicyclists or pedestrians is hard because there’s not much data measuring bicycle and pedestrian traffic before and after roads are relined. It may be, for instance, she said, that bike accidents escalate after a project is completed largely because more bicyclists use the added bike lanes. That looks to us like what happened on the on the Manor Road stretch, where bike traffic more than doubled with bike crashes only slightly going up. Bike lanes alone? We wondered if perhaps bike lanes alone result in double-digit crash reductions. To our inquiry, a University of Wisconsin urban planning professor, Robert Schneider, said by email that ""it is difficult to make a specific statement"" about how a particular bike lane reduces crashes, because that’s not what researches examine. Schneider, who teaches about pedestrian and bike safety, said research tends to be broader, looking at what experts call ""networks"" -- routes through whole cities or significant parts of cities -- to determine how easy and safe it is to get around on a bike. Research examining those networks, Schneider said, shows that bike-friendly cities help drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians stay safe. He cited a 2011 study from two engineers at the University of Colorado-Denver finding that when intersections and roads are easier for cyclists to navigate and more cyclists hit the road, drivers tend to slow down and be more aware of their surroundings. A Bike Austin leader, Miller Nuttle, informed of our findings, said its claim wasn’t worded as precisely as it should have been. Our ruling Bike Austin said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Research suggests big drops in pedestrian-vehicle accidents when sidewalks are introduced. But Bike Austin didn’t offer nor did we find research showing the addition of bike lanes in themselves or bike lanes plus sidewalks resulted in any percentage plummet in crashes. Instead, the city analysis states that reconfiguring lanes on part of one road, which also gained bike lanes, preceded 38 percent fewer crashes--with crash reductions averaging 29 percent among five road-diet projects.

Brad Rockwell,"Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer.""","Austin lawyer Brad Rockwell, who focuses on environmental matters, is former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance.
 
","Vivid image: Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler going to court to keep a judge from stopping petrochemicals from being dumped beneath Barton Springs. Austin attorney Brad Rockwell recently charged Adler, an eminent-domain lawyer, with doing just that. (Disclosure: Rockwell's daughter, Lilly Rockwell, covers city government for our parent newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. She wasn't involved in this fact check.) ""I met Steve Adler in litigation while he was representing a company who was dismantling the SOS ordinance,"" Rockwell said at a Nov. 12, 2014, press conference held with mayoral candidate Mike Martinez next to the lengthy spring-fed swimming pool. Adler and Martinez vie in a Dec. 16 runoff. At the press conference, Brad Rockwell was referring to the Save Our Springs law approved in 1992 to limit development potentially polluting the pool. Rockwell, former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, continued: ""Adler opposed our efforts to get an injunction to stop this company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" Did Adler battle for a company to dump oil ‘neath the pool? Adler represented Lowe’s It’s public record that Adler represented Lowe’s before an Austin state district judge in 2004 and opposed a temporary injunction, shortly granted, that kept Lowe’s from continuing to build a store in Southwest Travis County. In March 2005, though, the Austin City Council moved to settle the dispute, clearing the way for the Brodie Lane store. Adler and others went before a judge in July 2004 in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups that year intended to stop the Lowe’s project from being built on land in the heart of the Barton Springs recharge zone, described in Statesman news stories at the time as covering a 20-mile stretch of Travis and Hays counties. Rainfall in the zone percolates through soil and creek beds, a November 2003 Statesman news story said, replenishing the segment of the Edwards Aquifer that supplies not only Barton Springs but wells serving 50,000 residents. In question: Whether the plaintiffs were right that the construction was subject to the Save Our Springs ordinance limiting impervious cover to 15 percent or, as Lowe’s maintained, the company was free to put in up to 40 percent impervious cover in keeping with what Travis County permitted. In the July 1, 2004, hearing before Judge Scott Jenkins, Adler advanced reasons the project wasn’t subject to the SOS ordinance. Among his contentions: The land wasn’t in Austin’s purview, or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or if it was, the project still could proceed under looser development rules in place when plans were initially submitted to Sunset Valley. Engineer’s testimony And according to a hearing transcript, Adler didn’t say a word about whether Lowe’s should be allowed to pour petrochemicals into the earth. But during the hearing, parties seeking the injunction, including the city of Sunset Valley and Save Our Springs, called to the stand Lauren Ross, an environmental engineer, who testified about her visits to the construction site the day before. Asked if she observed conditions that would drive up average annual pollutants on the site after completion, Ross testified: ""There are clearly pollutants present on the site and discharging from the site that would not have been present prior to the beginning of the construction process."" Specifically, Ross said, she saw ""clear evidence of hydrocarbon sheens on the water in the construction rock"" around a fuel tank in violation of state requirements. Also, Ross testified, there’s ""no containment to prevent fuel spills from moving across the site."" She said that when she visited in the morning, a mesh silt fence intended to keep sediment from flowing off the site was breached at a spot where it looked to her like the land was graded to make all runoff head that way; she said the fence was restored by the time she returned in the afternoon. Most disturbing, Ross said, she saw that water running off the site wasn’t going into a culvert along Brodie Lane. Instead, she said, the flow was going into a hole in the ground onto limestone rock beneath, meaning all the project’s runoff was ""being discharged directly onto limestone that is presumably a recharge feature"" for the aquifer, she said. Asked what the flowing water looked like, Ross said the water had been filtered through the silt fence, but still had sediment and ""any of those escaping hydrocarbon sheens that we know are on the site at a more distant location."" Ross, asked her opinion of the environmental effect of the construction and on surrounding water features of the Lowe’s project, said: ""There is significant risk. And I think what I saw yesterday indicates it is much more than just a risk of contamination of downstream waters and the Edwards Aquifer from the proposed construction. It is clear that despite the engineering standards for erosion-type construction irrigation controls, these systems fail."" She also said she couldn’t recall seeing before the level of hydrocarbon sheens on a construction site that she saw on the Lowe’s site. Earlier in the hearing, Adler told the judge that stopping the $19 million project, which he called ""well underway,"" was ""going to cause greater environmental damage and greater harm than allowing the project to continue."" His legal contentions extended to mention of a 2003 state law intended to make the site subject only to Travis County’s development rules. Judge mentions ‘hydrocarbon spills’ Jenkins’ temporary injunction, issued July 2, 2004, said that if the construction continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury due to degradation of waters in nearby Williamson Creek, Barton Springs, the Edwards Aquifer and Sunset Valley water wells. The court further finds, Jenkins wrote, ""an increased risk of water pollution, were construction allowed to continue in violation of the SOS Ordinance, because of the failure risks inherent in man-made pollution-control features."" Also, Jenkins directed Lowe’s to ""ensure storm water runoff from the property be diverted from flowing into aquifer recharge features at or adjoining the property, that Lowe’s remove fuel tanks from the property, that Lowe’s remove from the property water contaminated by hydrocarbons and perform reasonable remediation of any hydrocarbon spills at the property."" In an interview, Rockwell stressed the judge’s order as an indication his statement was accurate as well as comments by Ross to the Austin Bulldog for a May 21, 2014, news story quoting her saying that what she saw the day before the hearing was ""totally my worst nightmare about why we need to minimize construction over the aquifer. The fuel storage tank failed, secondary containment around the tank failed. ... The silt fence was down, and there was direct migration into the Edwards Aquifer,"" Ross said. Adler calls claim 'outrageous' Adler called the dumping characterization outrageous. ""To dump petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer would be illegal in addition to being immoral,"" Adler said in an interview. ""Neither I nor Lowe’s nor co-counsel ever argued that the company should be able to dump petrochemicals into the aquifer."" The vital issue in court, Adler said, was whether a 4-3 vote by the Austin City Council in December 2003 was sufficient to let the development proceed. Save Our Springs and others successfully maintained in courts through 2004 that in keeping with the SOS ordinance, six council votes should have been required for the project to launch. Adler told us: ""Lowe’s doesn’t want to be dumping hydrocarbons down. No one in the courtroom would countenance dumping hydrocarbons down the aquifer."" Adler noted, too, that concerns about hydrocarbons going into the ground from the site weren’t part of pre-hearing briefs. Rockwell agreed, albeit pointing out no one knew of the oily sheen until the inspection visit by Ross. Rockwell, asked if his statement was an exaggeration, replied not. He also said that what he said at the press conference didn’t ""purport to summarize the whole litigation or everything about what the injunction fight was about. It’s one aspect, one very important aspect."" Other lawyers in the dispute To our inquiries, other lawyers in the dispute offered conflicting takes on this claim. Doug Young, the city attorney for Sunset Valley, which sided with the environmental groups in court, said by phone: ""Was Steve trying to vindicate the right of his client, Lowe’s, to dump petrochemicals down a recharge hole into the aquifer? No, I don’t think he was. But did he hear the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Ross that there were petrochemicals in the surface water there?"" Young added: ""It would be unreasonable to assume Lowe’s intended to dump that gas on the ground and either not worry about where it went or intend for it to go down this recharge feature. There’s no reason to believe that. But it happened. And they opposed"" the injunction to stop the construction. Daniel Byrne, who like Adler represented Lowe’s in the hearing, said by phone: ""The notion that anyone was pumping petrochemicals into the aquifer is complete garbage."" We emailed North Carolina-based Lowe’s about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" It’s not that simple. Adler, representing Lowe’s in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowe’s from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judge’s order in response said Lowe’s should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasn’t rooted in letting Lowe’s dump -- or stopping Lowe’s from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance.

Kasim Reed,"""State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay it a certain amount above appraisal.""
 ","
Kasim Reed is Mayor of Atlanta.
","The mayor said the state, specifically the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which is in charge of negotiations with the church, can only offer a certain amount of money. Reed explained during an Aug. 7 interview with Sports Radio 680 The Fan. ""The state has some limitations on what they can pay above the appraised price. ... We’re not going to be able to pay Mount Vernon $19.5 million because of the constraints that the state has in what they can pay,"" Reed said on the station’s program ""The Front Row."" The mayor went into more detail about a minute later. ""State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay a certain amount above appraisal,"" Reed said. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the mayor is correct. Is the state limited on how far it can move the financial goal posts to strike a deal with the church? The Atlanta Falcons have been working with the city, the GWCCA and others on a deal to build a new stadium, replacing the Georgia Dome, which is owned by the state. The city would prefer to build the new stadium on land south of the Dome, in large part because of its accessibility to MARTA rail lines. In order to build on that site, the city would need land where two longtime churches stand, Friendship Baptist Church and Mount Vernon. The initial deadline to work out a deal with the churches was Aug. 1. Although the city struck a deal with Friendship, the GWCCA was unable to do so with Mount Vernon. Reed held a news conference Aug. 6 asking all involved to continue the discussions. The $6.2 million value is included in a two-page revised appraisal letter completed July 30 for the state. The letter provides an ""as-is"" value for the church. The letter lists the value for the church at $30 per square foot, or roughly $3.4 million for 113,000 square feet. An additional $2.8 million is included for parking revenue. Reed’s communications director, Sonji Jacobs, referred to language in the Georgia Constitution, known as the Gratuities Clause, to explain the mayor’s point. State Properties Commission spokeswoman Cindy Presto referenced the same language in the constitution -- Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VI(a) -- when we contacted the agency seeking help. It reads: ""Except as otherwise provided in the Constitution, (1) the General Assembly shall not have the power to grant any donation or gratuity or to forgive any debt or obligation owing to the public, and (2) the General Assembly shall not grant or authorize extra compensation to any public officer, agent, or contractor after the service has been rendered or the contract entered into."" Said Jacobs: ""Basically, if the state does not pay appraised value, it could be thought to be providing an unearned benefit, which is not allowed under Georgia law."" Olens said in an email to PolitiFact that his office has for decades interpreted the Gratuities Clause in the state constitution as limiting the state to ""paying fair market value for property, absent some additional source of value that the state receives from the transaction."" The Attorney General’s Office believes there’s no gray area concerning state guidelines on appraisals, said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for Olens. ""It’s a black and white issue,"" she said. Kane said the appraisal value, absent a special circumstance, is considered the fair-market value that can be paid for a property. The proposed $1 billion stadium, she said, is not considered a special circumstance. When there is a dispute in appraisals, the state agency in some cases may accept the higher appraisal, Kane said. ""But as a general matter, the highest appraisal is the limit of what an agency may pay absent special circumstances,"" she said. ""No such dispute exists here, and there are no special circumstances."" The Attorney General’s Office has been involved in the negotiations with Mount Vernon. Kane said her office is unaware of any instances in which the state Supreme Court ruled contrary to attorney general opinions concerning the Gratuities Clause. The attorney general is the top attorney for state agencies, Olens said. He said the GWCCA must abide by attorney general rulings like this one. Olens is correct if a state agency is buying the property, Emory University law professor Frank Alexander said. ""An attorney general’s opinion under Georgia law is the opinion of the attorney general. It is usually seen to be binding for the AG’s clients, which are the state agencies,"" Alexander said. GWCCA spokeswoman Jennifer LeMaster said the sole purchaser of the Mount Vernon property would be the state, or the GWCCA as the state agency involved in the negotiations. On the purchase price guidelines, the agency defers to the attorney general, she said. Reed has worked independently to reach a deal with the church, announcing recently that Mount Vernon would agree to $15.5 million. But any amount over the $6.2 million would have to come from another party, likely in the form of a gift, LeMaster said. Will the deal for Mount Vernon be limited only to the $6.2 million in state money? Or will ""some other resources,"" as Reed described them in the interview, come into play. Stay tuned. Reed’s statement is based largely on the state attorney general’s interpretation of a portion of the Georgia Constitution, which is appropriate because the land will be purchased by a state agency. Given that, we reverse our earlier ruling. ",Janel Davis,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/aug/26/kasim-reed/mayor-correct-state-stadium-spending-limitations/,true

Scott has seats on the Judiciary and Education and Labor committees.
Scott previously served in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1979-83 and in the state Senate in 1983-93. He was a member of the National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve. He was a lawyer in a private practice from 1973-91.

","Scott said, ""Public schools are now as segregated by race and class as they were in the 1960s."" Scott’s claim doesn’t hold up for most of the 1960s, when Jim Crow still breathed and Southern states circumvented the Supreme Court’s 1954 order to integrate public schools. But he has a point, if we start in 1968, when 77% of Black students in the nation attended majority non-white schools. That dropped to 63% in the 1980s and then rose to 81% in 2019, the last year data is available. The ups and downs followed Supreme Court decisions that first toughened, then ended, integration mandates.

Gwen Moore,"Says Dontre Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee.""","U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore is a Democratic member of Congress, representing Wisconsin's 4th District, which primarily includes Milwaukee. Moore, who served in the state Legislature from 1989 to 2004, was elected to Congress in 2004.","Hamilton, a 31-year-old diagnosed with schizophrenia, had a history of contacts with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. He was shot to death by Christopher Manney, a Milwaukee officer who worked in the downtown area, on April 30, 2014. Manney was fired -- not for the fatal shooting itself, but for the way he approached Hamilton, which led to a scuffle. Here’s a summary of the incident from our Clinton fact check, based on a report by the Milwaukee County district attorney: First call: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee at the Starbucks located in Red Arrow Park downtown called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a ""welfare check"" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about ""a homeless guy sleeping"" there. Two officers respond: Because Manney didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification and said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left. Second call: About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers returned and told the employees that Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., about 90 minutes after the first call, Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked ""that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject"" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him.

Fight occurs: Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times.

Manney shoots Hamilton: The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. He fired 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. In announcing Manney’s firing, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Manney decided Hamilton was dangerous ""based solely on observations of apparent mental illness, absent any overt actions on the part of Mr. Hamilton."" Our rating Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."" Two officers twice responded to calls about Hamilton sleeping in the park and allowed him to continue sleeping there and left. He was still resting there when a different officer later and arrived and began patting him down. That triggered a physical altercation, with the officer hitting Hamilton with his baton and then Hamilton taking the baton and striking the officer. The officer then fatally shot Hamilton 14 times. In short, Hamilton was not shot simply for resting on a park bench. But the shooting occurred only because of a physical altercation that was sparked by the way the third officer began patting Hamilton down -- after two officers who came to the park twice decided Hamilton wasn’t doing anything wrong. In fact, the officer was fired for the way he approached Hamilton. Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee.""

Months later, Lotter strongly denied that Pence supports conversion therapy and said Pence was calling for funds to ""be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices"" Given Pence’s strong and extensive opposition to LGBT rights, his words in 2000 have been widely interpreted as supporting the controversial practice. Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force, has called them ""a dog whistle"" for like-minded supporters of conversion therapy.

Indeed, that happened. Another investigation into a bakery that withheld a wedding cake is pending in Oregon. Beck did not get into details about either case on his show.

Chain email,"""While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed.""","Chain emails circulate on the Internet, usually anonymously, making a variety of political claims.
","
We can say for certain that no book was ever banned. Nor is there any record that Palin initiated a formal process to censor any books.
 
June Pinell-Stephens, longtime chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Alaska Library Association, said she scoured the organization's archives and could find no record of any formal actions to ban books in Wasilla under Palin's tenure as mayor.
 
That jibes with Wasilla Library records as well.
 
""We have no records of any books being 'banned or censored' ever,"" Wasilla Mayor Diane M. Keller said in a statement released about the issue.
 
Keller told PolitiFact that the city hasn't been able to find any minutes to substantiate that the issue was ever raised by Palin at a City Council meeting. Nor does Keller, who was a council member at the time, recall any such conversations.
 
Jeanne Troshynski, president of the Friends of Wasilla Library, said the last formal request to remove a book came in 2005, with the challenge of a book written by Jon Stewart of

The Daily Show

called

America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction.

That was three years after Palin left office as mayor.
 
Wasilla records show the last formal challenge before that was in 1986 to

Bumps in the Night,

by Harvey Allard — well before Palin's tenure as mayor. In both cases, the challenges were denied and the books remained on the shelf.
 
But Kilkenny's e-mail doesn't claim that Palin initiated a formal process to ban books. In fact, Kilkenny said she does not recall that Palin even mentioned specific books that she wanted banned.
 
And Emmons, now Mary Ellen Baker, isn't talking.
 
A message on her answering machine states: ""I have nothing to add to reports from that time. I do not want to discuss the matter. Please respect my privacy.""
 
But the

Frontiersman

reporter who wrote that article in 1996 now says Emmons told him Palin did mention three books that she wanted removed from the shelves.
 
Paul Stuart is semiretired, though he still occasionally contributes articles to a weekly paper, the

Mountain Ear,

in Conway, N.H., where he lives.
 
Stuart told PolitiFact that in a conversation with Emmons after his article ran, she listed three titles. He said he could recall only two, and initially said they were

I Told My Parents I'm Gay

and

I Asked My Sister.

We looked for these titles; they don't appear to exist.
 
""Mary Ellen told me that Palin asked her directly to remove these books from the shelves,"" Stuart said. ""She refused.""
 
Asked later if the first book could have been

Pastor, I am Gay,

a controversial book written by a pastor who lives just outside Wasilla, Stuart said that was it.
 
Howard Bess, author of

Pastor, I am Gay

and former pastor of Church of the Covenant in nearby Palmer, recalls that his book challenging Christians to re-examine their ideas about and prejudices against gays and lesbians was not well received in Wasilla when it was published in 1995 — the year before Palin was elected mayor.
 
Virtually every book store in Wasilla refused to sell it.
 
Bess said he gave two copies to the Wasilla Library, but they quickly disappeared. So he donated more copies.
 
The controversy over the book was part of the context of that time period, he said. ""Knowing Sarah's religious connections and the people involved, I would be surprised if my book was not one of those at issue,"" Bess said. ""But I don't know that for a fact.""
 
""I don't think anyone has the facts except Mary Ellen, and she ain't talking,"" Bess said.
 
In addition to Kilkenny's e-mail, there is another one circulating widely with the subject line, ""The Books Sarah Palin tried to have banned."" It purports to be a list taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. (

Read it for yourself here.

)
 
The 93 titles appear to be a generic list of frequently banned books. It was not part of the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board.
 
In fact, the Harry Potter series listed didn't even begin until 1998, two years after this list is alleged to have been generated. In short, the list is a fake.
 
As for Kilkenny's claim, there is no proof that Palin tried to fire the librarian because she refused to consider removing books. In fact, Palin asked for the resignation of a handful of department heads to test their loyalty, according to reports at the time. The claim that Palin had specific books she wanted removed is also unsupported. Kilkenny herself said she does not recall that any titles were named by Palin at the time.
 
Yes, a reporter provides a secondhand account 12 years later in which he says the librarian named books Palin wanted removed. But Stuart's recollection seems hazy (he didn't get the right title at first). The librarian isn't talking. There are no public records or meeting minutes to substantiate the claim. And no one else corroborates that Palin ever listed any titles. So we find no basis to find that part of the story true.

","American Crossroads said Steyer ""stands to profit by blocking Keystone"" and ""is spending big to help"" Braley’s Senate campaign. At one point, this might have been an accurate ad.

However, Steyer has since left the investment group he started, and asked his company to divest any of his holdings from fossil fuels, including tar sands. He also donated his profits from the Kinder Morgan pipeline to charity. Further, as of 2014, Farallon is no longer invested in Keystone’s competitor, according to SEC filings.

","Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting recently claimed the GOP tax plan is ""nothing more than a middle class tax increase."" That doesn’t match up with estimates from the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative leaning Tax Foundation. They project the plan will result in a tax cut for about 90 percent of middle-income households nationwide in 2018. Those cuts would range from about $900 to $1,800. The remaining middle-income households would see their taxes stay the same or go up. The California Budget and Policy Center, a liberal leaning group, warns the plan will provide little if any help to middle- and low-income earners in high-tax California, given new limits placed on state and local tax deductions. But even with those new caps, plus a change to the mortgage interest deduction, national tax experts told us the vast majority of middle-class Californians -- up to 85 percent -- will still experience a tax cut in the plan’s first year. That could change by 2027 after the individual tax cuts expire, when households who make $75,000 or less are expected to see a tax hike. Congress could extend those cuts, though nothing is guaranteed. There might have been some truth to Ting’s statement had he said the plan was ""nothing more than a middle class tax increase"" — by 2027, after the cuts expire. But his statement ignores the fact that the vast majority in America’s, and California’s, middle class are expected to get a tax break between now and then.

Experts say this kind of research is not unusual and the experiment was conducted in accordance with accepted safety procedures. The mice used were highly susceptible to the virus.

Pfizer's clinical trial being administered to thousands of children worldwide including in the U.S. is designed to verify the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. The FDA's decision to authorize emergency use of the vaccine for children under age 5 would be based on the review of the scientific data available. This would likely include both an evaluation of effectiveness and safety, as the data review for children ages 5 to 11 had entailed in October. So the effectiveness of the two-dose course for children under age 5 would be scrutinized in the decision-making process. The urgency for a vaccine for young children stems from the effect of the omicron variant and its transmissibility. Children could fall sick and/or pass on the virus to others around them. Even with this urgency, the FDA's decision would be rooted in a scientific review.
