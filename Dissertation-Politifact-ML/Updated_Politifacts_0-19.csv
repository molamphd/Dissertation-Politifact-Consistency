Walgreens told leaders in 21 states that it won’t dispense the drug in states where abortion remains legal. But that list of states included four where abortion does remain legal — Alaska, Kansas, Iowa and Montana. However, those states have laws that restrict pharmacies like Walgreens from selling abortion pills, including requiring an in-person visit or an ultrasound, a doctor to provide the medication, or stipulating that only licensed physicians can perform abortions.  These types of restrictions are in effect in Alaska and Iowa and paused in the other two states amid litigation.  The blocked laws do not bar Walgreens and other pharmacies from dispensing the drug. But experts said Walgreens’ decision to withhold the drug in those states makes sense given the unsettled restrictions.

Joni Ernst,"The Obama administration issued an ""11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood.""","Joni Ernst is a Republican senator from Iowa. A former state senator, she won the 2014 GOP primary for an open U.S. Senate seat and defeated Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley in November. She was sworn into Congress in January 2015, replacing long-time Senator Tom Harkin.","About Title X Title X, as the federal rule notes, is the only federal program focused solely on providing family planning and related preventive services. In 2015, the rule says, more than 4 million individuals received services through more than 3,900 Title X-funded health centers. Planned Parenthood says its affiliates served approximately 1.5 million patients that year under Title X, about one-third of the federal program’s yearly total. Planned Parenthood has drawn criticism from anti-abortion advocates because in addition to providing uncontroversial women’s health services, the group also performs abortions. By law, abortions performed by Planned Parenthood are paid for by private money, not federal dollars. But anti-abortion advocates argue that money is fungible and that the federal government is effectively supporting a major provider of abortions. Supporters of Planned Parenthood counter that the money flows are separated and that barring federal dollars from being spent on Planned Parenthood would have dire negative consequences for women’s health, especially among poor Americans. The Obama administration rule On Sept. 7, 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a ""notice of proposed rulemaking"" -- the first step in formulating a new federal rule. The proposed rule would make clear that the decision to fund an organization under Title X cannot be based on ""reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services."" The effect would be that the fact of providing abortion services couldn’t be used against a group that seeks Title X funding. After the notice of proposed rulemaking was issued, the rule went through a series of required steps, including a public comment period. Ultimately, HHS acted to finalize the rule while the Obama administration was still in charge, but after Donald Trump had won the 2016 presidential election. HHS made the rule effective Jan. 18. Though the proposal was framed broadly, it was widely perceived as having a significant impact on Planned Parenthood. Both sides essentially agreed on that. After the notice of proposed rulemaking, Ernst and other lawmakers immediately expressed concern to HHS about its impact on Planned Parenthood. And after the rule was finalized, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said in a statement that ""President Obama has cemented his legacy as a champion for women's health. This rule protects birth control, cancer screenings, (sexually-transmitted infection) testing and treatment and other health care for millions of people."" Evaluating Ernst’s description So how well does Ernst’s characterization stack up? We’ll take her statement phrase by phrase. • ""11th-hour rule."" While all relevant procedures were followed in the formulation of the rule, the final rule did materialize quicker than many federal rules do, experts said. ""The rule was proposed in September and finalized in December,"" said Columbia Law School professor Gillian Metzger. ""In practice, that's a pretty fast turnaround."" And of course, by making the effective date Jan. 18, 2017, it took effect in the final 48 hours of the Obama administration. All told, Ernst has a strong case for calling it an ""11th-hour"" rule. • ""Entrenches federal family planning funding."" Experts told PolitiFact that the Obama rulemaking did make the policy harder to overturn, although either Congress or Trump’s HHS department could take steps to do so. ""I would not quibble about the use of ‘entrench’ in this context,"" said Boston University law professor Gary S. Lawson. ""Rules are not that easy to change. There are degrees of entrenchment, of course, depending on the procedures required for change, but if someone wants to apply the term to a substantive agency rule, I would let them do it."" Metzger agreed. ""As a practical matter, reversing a rule takes resources and time by the agency, and there would likely be a court challenge and the possibility that a court would repeal the reversal as arbitrary."" • ""For Planned Parenthood."" As we noted earlier, both sides in the abortion debate publicly linked the rule to Planned Parenthood. That said, the rule did not exclusively target Planned Parenthood. The rule itself does not mention the organization by name, although the accompanying material does mention the group specifically in a question-and-answer section summarizing public comments. ""While Planned Parenthood might be one of the affected applicants, the rule is actually written in a neutral manner,"" said Jeffrey S. Lubbers, an American University law professor.  Our ruling Ernst said the Obama administration issued an ""11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood."" Ernst said the Obama administration issued an ""11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood.""

He’s supported personhood bills that recognized life as beginning at the moment of conception or fertilization and bestowed human embryos with legal rights. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says such legislation could outlaw birth control pills and other forms of contraception that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Cuccinelli’s wording also allows him to gloss over a vote he cast in 2003 against legislation that would have specified contraception does not constitute an abortion.

Sarah Ponder,"Says $800,000 cost of Texas special legislative session would pay for 1.6 million condoms, 90,000 months of the pill or 20 full-time sexual health educators.","
PolitiFact Texas did a fact-check on a sign carried by Sarah Ponder of Austin during a July 1, 2013, rally at the Capitol against proposed abortion legislation. Ponder works for an education technology firm and said she had attended the rally to show support for effective ways to reduce the number of abortions performed.
","
Ponder used a conservative estimate for the cost of the second special session, presuming it runs for the full 30 days. She used the lowest price we found for the pill, a mid-range price for condoms and a salary that doesn’t seem out of line for an entry-level sexual health educator position, so it’s probably true that under certain circumstances, you could pay for the items on her sign with $800,000 apiece. 
Then again, it might be fairer to estimate the pill at $25 a month instead of $9, which means you could only pay for 32,000 months of contraception, not the 90,000 months she cited. And unless you only wanted to hire newly-graduated sexual health educators, you might have to pay them more like $52,000 per year, which would cover 16 instead of 20 educators. 
So an adjusted version of the sign might read: ""$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 32,000 months of the pill, 16 full-time sexual health educators"" instead of ""$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 90K months of the pill, 20 full-time sexual health educators.""

This all means that anyone purchasing a plan with abortion coverage will be be doing so by choice and paying for it personally. 
On March 16, 2012, Johnson, of the National Right to Life Committee, and his colleague, senior legislative counsel Susan T. Muskett, raised an issue about the way the law is worded. They wrote that ""if a health plan covers abortion, the rule forbids the plan from calling attention to that fact in any of its advertising or explanatory materials. The disclosure of abortion coverage can be provided ‘only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment.’ This provision seems designed for no other purpose than to ensure that many people who would not deliberately sign up for abortion-covering plans will do so inadvertently."" 
The text of the law does include this line: ""A qualified health plan that provides for coverage of (elective abortion) shall provide a notice to enrollees, only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment, of such coverage."" 
This use of the word ""only"" does seem to raise the risk that a plan’s abortion provisions won’t be fully transparent to the buyer. But we think the law does ensure disclosure for any potential purchaser who is paying attention. 
HHS describes the disclosure summary in question as something akin to the nutritional labels on food -- a standardized form that will allow consumers to easily compare one plan’s features to another’s before they buy. 
""Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services,"" said HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields. 
Our ruling 
The claim that the Obama administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" is ridiculous; the administration has simply set a floor for how much money per month of the premiums paid by those who have chosen plans that include abortion must be placed in a segregated account in order to make sure that there’s enough money available to pay for abortion services incurred by people enrolled in that plan.

Attacking his election opponent as ""crazier than you think,"" Mehmet Oz tweeted an ad to his 3.8 million Twitter followers that made this claim: ""John Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities."" Oz, a physician and former TV talk show host, is the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Fetterman, a Democrat, is the state’s lieutenant governor.

And in a video ad published on YouTube July 14, Oz said Fetterman ""supports releasing one-third of the prison population."" To back up the claim, Oz’s campaign referred PolitiFact to a June 22 article in the conservative-leaning Daily Caller and to two Fetterman tweets cited in the article. The article said Fetterman twice in 2020 ""appeared to endorse"" releasing one-third of the state’s prison population.  In May 2020, Fetterman tweeted: ""PA’s Correction Secretary has said: ‘We could reduce our prison population by 1/3 and not make anyone less safe.’"" And in July 2020, he tweeted: ""Our Corrections Secretary has said we could"" release ""1/3 of our inmates and not make anyone less safe.

In announcing in September 2021 that Wetzel would leave the post, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, praised Wetzel for reducing the state’s prison population. PolitiFact searched Google, the Nexis news archive, and Wetzel’s Twitter account, and did not find an instance in which Wetzel made such a statement, so we asked Fetterman’s campaign about the Wetzel remarks. Spokesperson Joe Calvello responded that the campaign could not find the exact quote, but that Wetzel has made similar comments, such as in 2021, when Wetzel advocated for medical parole for elderly inmates, saying most who would be eligible ""are incapacitated and not a security threat."" Calvello said that Fetterman was not expressing an opinion on releasing one-third of its inmates but was citing Wetzel’s comments to highlight the cost of Pennsylvania’s prison system.  We tried to reach Wetzel via LinkedIn and his consultant agency on Facebook, but got no reply. On Aug. 17, Fox News posted a story that linked to a video from an Oct. 7, 2020, panel discussion on reducing incarceration.

He said he agreed with a statement he attributed to Wetzel that ""we could reduce our prison population by a third and not make anyone less safe in Pennsylvania."" Fetterman has called for ""second chances"" for offenders, such as eliminating mandatory life-without-parole sentences for certain murder convictions and for other criminal justice reforms. Fetterman’s campaign website includes one video promoting his record as lieutenant governor in increasing pardons for prison inmates in Pennsylvania; in the other video, Fetterman calls for overhauling the criminal justice system, saying, ""There are individuals that, quite frankly, don’t need to be in prison, it doesn’t make anyone more safe.""

Ron DeSantis,"Clips of Dr. Anthony Fauci show he “flip-flopped” on guidance for wearing masks, whether kids should be in school and whether people should change how they interact.","Ron DeSantis won the race for Florida governor in 2018 and 2022. DeSantis, a Republican, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and resigned in September 2018 to focus on his campaign. He represented Florida's 6th Congressional District which is south of St. Augustine and north of Orlando and includes Daytona Beach. DeSantis initially ran for U.S. Senate in 2016 but dropped out after Marco Rubio decided to seek re-election.","A new ad for DeSantis accuses Fauci of ‘flip-flopping’ on guidance for mask wearing, school closures and COVID-19 precautions. The ad splices together various clips of Fauci speaking, but selectively omits key context, words and caveats that would explain the changes in guidance and provide a more accurate picture of his position. These omissions and edits fundamentally alter the story that is being told. When Fauci said people did not need to walk around in masks, it was before scientists knew COVID-19 could be spread asymptomatically. When he said masks work, he indicated they do not work 100% but can help stem infection spread. When he said that fully vaccinated people should wear masks, he was talking about how to behave safely indoors after new data showed vaccinated people with breakthrough infections could transmit the highly contagious delta variant. When he said children should be kept home, his comments were specific to areas where there was high transmission early in the pandemic, before vaccines. When he said people didn’t need to change their behavior, it was in February 2020 when U.S. cases were few, but he added the caveat that that guidance could change. When he advised personal interaction should be diminished, it was March 2020, and he was speaking specifically of young people crowding into bars and restaurants.   The ad contains an element of truth in that it does quote words that came out of Fauci’s mouth. But these statements came at different points in the pandemic as scientists understood more about COVID-19. The video is edited in such a way as to mislead by ignoring critical facts and cutting out words that would give a different impression.

He previously ran for two other Texas U.S. House seats.,"Garza’s ad stated: ""They call"" Jan. 6 ""an insurrection,"" but ""were FBI agents used as political agitators?"" He repeated a claim that has been repeatedly debunked, as there is no evidence that the attack on the Capitol was instigated by FBI agents.  In January, Ray Epps, an Arizona man whom Carlson and others held up as a possible undercover FBI agent or informant, said he had no ties to the FBI; and Rally Runner, another man singled out on Carlson’s show, said on Carlson’s segment that suggesting he was a federal agent was a ""false story."" We sent emails to the address listed on Garza’s campaign website and on his campaign organization statement, but did not receive a reply. Garza describes himself as an entrepreneur in commercial real estate, consumer products and hospitality. A news article on his 2020 campaign described him as the owner of a popular San Antonio nightclub. Garza is vying for an open seat in Texas’ reorganized 15th Congressional District, which includes areas around San Antonio, Corpus Christi and communities to the south. The seat is open because the incumbent, Democrat Vicente Gonazles, chose to run for House District 34 after Republican redistricting made District 15 more competitive. The Cook Political Report, Inside Elections and Sabato’s Crystal Ball all rate the race as ""lean"" or ""tilt"" Republican.  Garza is one of nine Republicans running in the March 1 primary, along with six Democrats.  This is Garza’s third run for the House. In 2018, he won less than 1% of the vote in the GOP primary in the 21st district; in 2020, he won the GOP primary in District 20, but lost to the incumbent, Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro.  Garza’s ad stated: ""They call"" Jan. 6 ""an insurrection,"" but ""were FBI agents used as political agitators?""

However, because the tests were stored safely, the FDA has allowed the tests to be used by March 2022. Nearly all tests have been distributed to testing sites, according to the state’s health department. DeSantis has acknowledged the tests twice passed their expiration dates in 2021. He attributed that to little demand from testing sites during most of the second half of 2021 and pending federal approval regarding the tests’ safety.  ",Tom Kertscher,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/04/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-overstates-claim-about-millions-expi/,barely-true
