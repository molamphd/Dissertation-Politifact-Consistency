She represented Wisconsin’s Second Congressional District from January 1999 to January 2013. She served as a member of the Wisconsin Assembly from January 1993 to January 1999. She was a Dane County supervisor from 1986 to 1994 and briefly served on the Madison Common Council, filling a vacancy, in 1986.","Baldwin says Americans are paying more for remdesivir than people in other countries, and the Trump Administration is to blame. The price element is correct. On average, Americans insured by private health insurance companies could be on the hook for an additional $780 over what people in countries with national health systems may pay.  But the blame element misses the mark. While Trump may have a slight influence over drug prices with his appointee to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is really no way for the administration to step in and tell Gilead to charge less for remdesivir without a change in federal laws or invoking a rarely used maneuver to effectively seize the patent from the company. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin called for change in the prices of a coronavirus drug, placing blame on the current administration for letting the prices rise so high.  Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) in a Nov. 19, 2020, tweet said Americans are paying the highest price in the world for a drug meant to combat the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to the Trump administration.  The drug, remdesivir, was the first medication released after the coronavirus pandemic began. It was developed by Gilead Sciences and largely funded with money from U.S. taxpayers, according to a July 23, 2020, article from PolitiFact.  The antiviral is designed to keep the virus from making copies of itself and spreading. A clinical trial in April found that patients who were given the drug recovered more quickly than those who were given placebo pills, but the study was not clear if the drug improved survival, according to an Oct. 15, 2020, report from the New York Times.  Attached to Baldwin’s tweet is a Nov. 16 letter to Alex Azar, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requesting information on price negotiations with the company making the drug. The letter is signed by Baldwin, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Tina Smith (D-Minnesota), Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont), Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).   The senators in the letter request that the federal government take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority, which could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug.  But is Baldwin right? Is the drug really more expensive in the U.S. than other countries? And are those prices the fault of President Donald Trump’s administration? Let’s break down the tweet.  Americans do pay more for remdesivir than people elsewhere. In a June 29, 2020 open letter from Daniel O’Day, the chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences, said each dose of the antiviral medicine will cost $520 for those on private insurance in the U.S. For the entire treatment, consisting of six doses of the medicine, the cost is $3,120.  For those on government-sponsored insurance, such as Medicare and Medicaid, remdesivir will cost $390 per vial, or $2,340 per treatment, the letter said. That price will also apply to those in other countries with national health care systems.  Countries such as Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have national health care systems.  So is the drug more expensive in the U.S.?  Yes, for people on private insurance in the U.S., the drug will cost more than what people in countries with national health care systems pay.  That’s similar to price trends with other drugs, though, said Cody Wenthur, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Pharmacy.  ""U.S. drug prices have been calculated to be about four times higher on average than prices in other nations,"" he said.  And what about the claim that the Trump administration is at fault for the price of the drug? It’s not that simple. The president does have a small bit of influence, said Edmund Elder, the director of the Zeeh Pharmaceutical Experiment Station within the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy. The secretary of the U.S. Department Health and Human Services is a cabinet member, chosen by the president, and that department does oversee the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And CMS negotiates drug prices for those receiving government-subsidized healthcare, setting a price that can dictate prices for the rest of the market as well, Elder said.  But the government is still not directly involved, because Congress doesn’t have the authority to tell companies — or the middle-man companies, called Pharmacy Benefits Managers — what to charge.  ""They can’t say you can’t charge more for a drug,"" he said.  Wenthur said the federal government actually plays little direct role in the setting of prices for the general public because it implemented rules to limit its own ability to influence drug prices. Also, the federal government is only one actor in the realm that sets the prices of prescription drugs. Other actors include health insurance companies, large employers, or other payers, all of which are typically represented by a Pharmacy Benefits Manager.  But unlike other stakeholders in the process, the government can modify the rules of the system that determines prices, Wenthur said. ""Whenever shortcomings in drug pricing or health care delivery are suggested to be the fault of any given administration, it generally implies that they haven’t been active enough in using their authority to optimize the system itself,"" he said.  When asked about the claim that Trump could lower prices, Baldwin’s office pointed to the letter, which notes the government could take over the production and distribution of the drug with compulsory licensing authority. That could be used to acquire lower-cost versions of the drug.  ""The U.S. government frequently used this authority in the 1960s to acquire lower-cost versions of the on-patent drugs, and has used it to acquire patented military equipment,"" the letter says. ""Some advocates have argued that using this authority could ‘provide adequate supply (of remdesivir) while pushing prices down.’"" That power has not been used since the 1960s and 1970s, according to a 2017 study in the Yale Journal of Law & Technology, though there has been a renewed push to once again rely on compulsory licensing authority due to rising drug costs. 
  But, in a Nov. 25, 2020 opinion piece in The Hill, Sean O’Connor, a professor of law and the executive director at the Center for the Protection of Intellectual Property at George Mason University, said that by using compulsory licensing, the government would essentially be stealing the patent for remdesivir from Gilead. And while the company would be able to sue the government for full compensation if that were to happen, he said, the government is not authorized to infringe on patents any more than everyday individuals.  ""Ultimately, drug prices are driven more by other factors in the health care system than by patent rights that incentivize lifesaving innovations,"" he said.  Pilar Ossorio, a professor of law and bioethics at UW-Madison said that while the U.S. government has the ability to ""take"" a patent and begin licensing a drug for production to drive down prices, it’s unlikely it will happen.  ""I think as a policy matter (the government) sees the right of intellectual property as so powerful and useful in the development of inventions,"" she said, that the government would be highly reluctant to take such a step because it would discourage other companies from pursuing their own advances.  And, she said, because of the emphasis the U.S. has put on the importance of intellectual property rights, there is a chance the U.S. Supreme Court could invalidate portions of the code that allows the government to take patents.  Baldwin says Americans are paying more for remdesivir than people in other countries, and the Trump Administration is to blame. The price element is correct. On average, Americans insured by private health insurance companies could be on the hook for an additional $780 over what people in countries with national health systems may pay.  But the blame element misses the mark. While Trump may have a slight influence over drug prices with his appointee to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is really no way for the administration to step in and tell Gilead to charge less for remdesivir without a change in federal laws or invoking a rarely used maneuver to effectively seize the patent from the company.

Michael Caputo,“Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?”,Michael Caputo is the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. Caputo is a former adviser to Donald Trump. He also ran Carl Paladino's 2010 gubernatorial campaign.,"In a tweet, the HHS assistant secretary for public affairs said that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""forced"" nursing homes across the state to admit COVID-positive patients and that this policy fueled the spread of COVID-19 that led to thousands of deaths in the nursing home population. Although nursing homes felt pressure to accept COVID-positive patients, they were not actually forced to do so. State regulations require nursing homes to accept patients only if they can care for them, and they could have refused them on those grounds. In addition, it’s unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Infection control is a longstanding problem in nursing homes that predates the pandemic and a report showed peak numbers of nursing home deaths came prior to the peak influx of patients as a result of Cuomo’s advisory. While the introduction of COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on infection spread, Caputo’s statement suggests it was solely responsible. That’s not what the evidence shows. On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was among the first in a weeklong parade of speakers to issue scathing critiques of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response. Cuomo’s criticisms drew a quick reply in a tweet from Michael R. Caputo, an assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. ""Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?"" he wrote. It was an easy jab: Cuomo has been dogged by criticism for months over his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. As long as they were medically stable, the notice said, it was appropriate to move patients in. Further, nursing homes were prohibited from requiring that medically stable prospective residents be tested for the virus before they arrived. Between March 25 and May 8, approximately 6,326 COVID-positive patients were admitted to nursing homes, according to a state health department report. While experts say this policy was flawed, is it fair to say that the governor’s directive ""forced"" nursing homes to take patients who were sick with COVID-19? And to what extent did that strategy sow the seeds of disease and death? When we examined the evidence, we found it was less clear cut than the statement makes it seem. The policy likely had an effect, but epidemiologists identified additional factors that fed the problem. What’s more the policy did not ""force"" nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients. Nursing homes interpreted it this way.  We checked with HHS to find the basis for Caputo’s comment but got no response. As the virus tore through nursing homes, killing dozens at some of them, Cuomo came under withering censure. His administration’s policy, implemented with an eye toward freeing up hospital beds for an onslaught of COVID patients, seemed to disregard the risks to frail and elderly nursing home residents who were especially vulnerable to the disease. According to the COVID Tracking Project, 6,624 people have died of COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in New York, accounting for 26% of the state’s 25,275 COVID deaths. Some say the true number of deaths is much higher because, unlike many states, New York does not count the deaths of former nursing home residents who are transferred to hospitals and die there as nursing home deaths.

Facebook posts,“The CDC just confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19.”,"Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","Background On Mortality Figures On March 3, the World Health Organization announced that 3.4% of confirmed coronavirus patients around the world had died. That figure is what epidemiologists call a ""case fatality rate.""  The ratio is ""crudely calculated by dividing the number of reported deaths over the number of reported confirmed cases,"" Carla Drysdale, a WHO spokeswoman, told PolitiFact National in March. She also said the ratio would change over time and vary from place to place.  But the mortality rate, or ""death rate"" as the Facebook posts terms it, is much more difficult to determine. It is calculated by dividing the number of people who die from COVID-19 in a certain geographic area by the total estimated number of people infected. It doesn’t rely solely on confirmed deaths and infections. The biggest problem is the denominator. Many who develop mild cases of COVID-19 or show no signs at all are never tested and thus aren’t counted, skewing the ratio.  Did The CDC Really ‘Confirm’ A 0.2% Death Rate? The Facebook post’s claim that the CDC ""confirmed"" a 0.2% death rate draws on information in a planning document the federal agency published in May. The 0.2% figure is included, but it’s the lowest in a range of five estimates. Earlier this month, USA Today analyzed the five scenarios in the document while fact-checking the same claim about a 0.2% death rate that had spread widely on Facebook and Instagram.  ""The first four are varying estimates of the disease's severity, from low to high, while the fifth represents the 'current best estimate,'"" USA Today reported. ""The range of estimates put the fatality rate for those showing symptoms between 0.2%-1%, with a 'best estimate' of 0.4%. It also places the number of asymptomatic cases between 20%-50%, with a 'best estimate' of 35%. By combining the two estimates, the estimated overall fatality rate of those infected with the virus – with and without symptoms – would be 0.26%.""  The USA Today fact check concluded that saying the CDC has ""confirmed"" 0.2% as the death rate ""paints a misleading picture because the CDC has clearly stated the number is subject to change. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the claim in the social media posts is simply ""wrong. The CDC did not confirm that."" He estimated COVID-19’s death rate at ""between 0.8% and 1.0%.""  ""No serious examination of the data from this pandemic would lead one to conclude that 0.2% is a realistic possibility,"" Jha wrote in an email.  The Facebook posts also attribute several quotes to ""the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute."" An online search shows Jha made similar statements, but on a completely separate topic.  ""This is pretty stunning to me — my quote being misused to promote a falsehood,"" Jha said, noting he had not been aware of the posts before being contacted by PolitiFact California. Several health experts have described the CDC estimates as low and lacking in transparency.  Nicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health,  questioned the CDC’s 0.26% mortality rate, saying ""it’s not transparent where that comes from."" ""That’s very much on the low-end of what’s been reported by good studies,"" he added.  The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.  Health officials have cited a May study from the University of Washington, which estimated that if all infections were known, the true death rate for Americans who show symptoms would be about 1.3%. From a public health perspective, Jewell said that claims like the one spreading on Facebook can ""do a lot of damage, largely because when it’s seized on, it undercuts your message"" to continue social distancing and wearing masks.  ""The whole idea that this wasn’t so bad is just, in my view, nonsense,"" Jewell said. Asked about the mortality rate claim in the Facebook posts, Novotny, the professor of epidemiology at San Diego State University, said ""it misrepresents what the risks are.""  Comparing COVID 19’s Mortality Rate To Influenza In March, Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told PolitiFact National that most experts believe the ultimate death rate for this coronavirus will wind up being higher than the rate for seasonal flu, which hovers around 0.1%. That lines up with what Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress during his March testimony. ""The percent mortality will depend on what the denominator of number of cases is,"" Fauci said. ""So if you’re not counting every case, the mortality will be high. If you are counting a lot of cases that are sub-clinical, mortality will become low. But no matter how you slice it, it’s many, many, many more times lethal than the influenza that we get in the season."" Our ruling Facebook posts claim the CDC ""confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19.""  The claim draws from the low-end of a range of estimates the CDC published in May saying the fatality rate for those showing symptoms was between 0.2% and 1%, with a ""best estimate"" of 0.4%. The estimated overall mortality rate of those with and without symptoms would be 0.26%.  Health experts, however, said it’s difficult to pin down a precise mortality rate early in a pandemic and that the federal agency hasn’t yet ""confirmed"" any rate but instead offered best guesses. Over time, it is possible that estimates will show a lower than initially expected mortality rate, especially as more testing is conducted in the United States.  Currently, however, the true number of deaths and infections are hard to determine, as some deaths caused by the virus aren’t counted and many people with mild cases of the coronavirus are never tested.  Several experts said they project the mortality rate is on the higher-end of the CDC’s estimated range, closer to 1%, which is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.  In the end, the post wrongly suggests that health officials have established COVID-19’s true mortality rate and selectively picks the low-end of a range of estimates.  Facebook posts claim the CDC ""confirmed a 0.2% death-rate for COVID19.""  The claim draws from the low-end of a range of estimates the CDC published in May saying the fatality rate for those showing symptoms was between 0.2% and 1%, with a ""best estimate"" of 0.4%.

Andrew Cuomo, “Why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance.”,"Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, was elected to his first term as governor of New York in 2010.
","The CDC's guidance at the time of the March 25 state order was that COVID-19 patients who are medically stable can be discharged from a hospital to a nursing home, but only if the nursing home can implement all recommended infection control procedures. CMS, a federal agency that regulates nursing homes, issued similar guidance, and also said that preferably, coronoavirus patients should be cared for in a dedicated unit.  Like CDC and CMS, the state Health Department said only those patients who are medically stable can be discharged, and also recommended that nursing homes consider dedicated units, if possible. The Health Department prohibited nursing homes from requiring a COVID-19 test before admitting a resident, while CMS said new residents should be tested, but did not require it.  The Cuomo administration points to state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require facilities to accept only those patients they can care for. In addition, earlier state communications encouraged nursing homes to stay current with CDC guidance. But once the state issued its March 25 advisory, nursing home operators said that they felt they had no choice but to accept residents who were either known to be infected or suspected to be. That’s because the March 25 memo did not say anything about making sure that a nursing home can care for a patient before making an admission decision, and said they ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents."" In the month following the memo, nursing homes pleaded for relief from the order.  ",Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/13/andrew-cuomo/new-yorks-nursing-home-policy-was-not-line-cdc/,barely-true

 ","A Facebook post said Texas and Florida have a ""balanced budget"" while California is ""in debt $54 billion"" and New York is ""in debt $6.1 billion."" This post misleads readers in multiple ways. First, it is possible to have debt and a balanced budget. Second, the post mixes up debt with budget shortfalls. All four states carry billions in debt. Third, it’s difficult to compare the current financial status of four different states because they have different budget cycles and the impact of the pandemic remains a moving economic target.  While Florida and Texas have passed balance budgets, they too are certain to face economic woes related to the pandemic.  In early May, California officials projected a $54 billion shortfall, but a new budget proposal lays out a plan to balance the budget, although it still leaves a projected future deficit.  The $6.1 billion figure for New York stems from projections late last year about a shortfall, and ignores that the state has since passed a balanced budget.

Facebook posts,Gates Foundation stands to make nearly £31.5 billion on a coronavirus vaccine in U.K.,"Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","A Facebook post and several blog articles claim that the Gates Foundation could make more than £30 billion from a coronavirus vaccine. That number is based on multiplying a reported estimate of the cost of a potential COVID-19 vaccine times the population of the U.K. But the company developing the vaccine has not publicly released an estimate. And while the Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential coronavirus vaccines, there is no evidence that it stands to profit from them.

Bloggers,“It’s not the coronavirus that’s killing people. It is the economy.”,Blog posting on the Internet,"A TikTok user said it’s the economic downturn, not the coronavirus, ""that’s killing people."" He brought up the statistic that a 1% rise in unemployment causes 58,000 additional deaths over five years, due to heart attacks, drug abuse and other ""diseases of despair."" The researcher whose work lies behind that statistic said it doesn’t apply and that he has no question that current deaths, now over 80,000, stem from the virus. No analyst said the immediate scale of deaths could be tied to rising unemployment.

This is untrue. While the metric Trump highlighted is important, there are countless countries performing far better than the United States on COVID deaths per capita. And it is misleading at best to categorize the American fatality count in the same group as Germany’s; Germany’s numbers are better.

Facebook posts,Says gloves shouldn’t be worn in public because “if you are wearing the same set of gloves all over town you are only spreading germs everywhere you go.”,"Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","A viral Facebook post warned against wearing gloves in public because keeping the same set on means ""you are only spreading germs everywhere you go."" Infectious disease experts around the country agree gloves largely do more harm than good. They don’t really protect the wearer since the coronavirus doesn’t seep in through the skin. And they don’t limit the disease spread since they are often worn too long or removed incorrectly. And perhaps most notably, wearing gloves can stop users from washing hands as often, which is the step that actually kills the coronavirus.
