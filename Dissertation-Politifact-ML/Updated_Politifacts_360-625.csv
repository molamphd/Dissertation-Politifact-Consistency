You’re talking about millions and millions of dollars — billions of dollars — of economic consequence, if we continue with this rhetoric around shutting down the border without considering what that means.""",Gavin Newsom was elected governor of California in 2018. He is the state's former lieutenant governor and served as mayor of San Francisco. He is a Democrat.,"California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom claimed there was an estimated $5.3 million in economic loss from the temporary closure of the San Ysidro border crossing that separates San Diego and Tijuana on Nov. 25. He added ""billions of dollars"" are potentially at stake should future closures take place. Newsom’s $5.3 million figure was supported by the head of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce, which represents hundreds of businesses on the U.S. side of the border. A leading economist in the region said San Ysidro is likely to recover at least some of that loss when shoppers who delayed their visits return, as long as there aren’t additional border closures. Newsom can also point to warnings from business groups about ""billions of dollars"" potentially being lost in future shutdowns. San Diego’s regional chamber of commerce, including the city’s former Republican mayor, said future closures could threaten the billions of dollars in economic activity that flows through the international gateway. This portion of Newsom’s claim, however, assumes a worst-case scenario of a prolonged weeks- or months-long closure. While President Trump has threatened to close the border, there’s been no evidence that his administration is seeking an extended shutdown. We found Newsom’s overall statement was accurate but could use some clarifications.

When we asked, Lauren Willis of the comptroller’s office emailed us its chart indicating that in 2015, Texas had a gross domestic product of $1.59 trillion -- placing it 10th among countries behind the U.S. ($17.95 trillion) and eight countries including Brazil ($1.77 trillion). The chart shows Texas ahead of No. 11 Canada ($1.55 trillion) as well as Korea, Russia, Australia, Spain, Mexico and four other countries. GDP, the most-used measure of national economic output, is defined as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in country.

Willis also pointed out a World Bank breakout of GDPs by nation for 2015; the presented figures didn’t perfectly align with the comptroller’s chart, we found, though the ranking of the top 10 countries did.

Scott Walker,"""From 2010-2014, median household income"" in Wisconsin ""has actually gone up 7.4 percent.""
 ","Scott Walker, a Republican, is the former governor of Wisconsin. He was first elected in November 2010. He survived a recall election in 2012, defeating Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett after igniting controversy with a bill curtailing public-employee union collective-bargaining rights.  He won re-election to a four-year term in November 2014 and was a 2016 presidential candidate before dropping out in September of 2015. He was defeated by Tony Evers in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Walker is a former Milwaukee County executive and former member of the state Assembly.","Walker had cited U.S. Census data, usually a gold-standard source. But the data was from the census’ Current Population Survey. That set is good for the national income picture, but less accurate at the state level. The better data is from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, a rolling collection of household and demographic statistics from 3.5 million addresses. Those figures revealed a much different picture than Walker had painted: An income drop nationally, yes -- of 1.72 percent. But also an income drop -- not an increase, as Walker stated -- in Wisconsin of 1.62 percent. So, what about the governor’s claim this time? The news story The Journal Sentinel’s article reported on newly released data from the American Community Survey covering two periods: 2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2014. Median household income fell by a significant margin in two-thirds of Wisconsin counties during the period. Importantly, the article reported figures that are adjusted for inflation. By the way, think of median household income as the midpoint: Half of Wisconsin households have an income higher than the median, and half have an income that is lower. Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick emailed the Journal Sentinel about the article, saying it was distorted because it did not include the 7.4 percent figure Walker cited in his tweet. The Journal Sentinel asked her for the data that produced that figure. What the newspaper found was that Walker used American Community Survey data -- but didn’t properly adjust for inflation. That means he compared 2010 dollars to 2014 dollars, an economic no-no. Whenever you are looking at income, ""you should be looking at real income instead of nominal income, which means you adjust for changes,"" said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University in Milwaukee and former chief economist of the United Nations Economic Commission in Europe. Otherwise, he said, you’re looking at apples and oranges. ""$100 today is not the same as $100 last year,"" Chowdhury said. ""If you adjust for price, what you get is the real change in your buying power."" For the news article and for this analysis, the Journal Sentinel used the Consumer Price Index from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust for inflation. Here’s what the adjusted data show: Walker’s method: ""What you are doing is the right approach, looking at real income instead of nominal income,"" Chowdhury said.

Terry McAuliffe,"""When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit. You know what? We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history.""","Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, was elected governor of Virginia on Nov. 5, 2013. He received 47.8 percent of the vote in defeating Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who came in at 45.2 percent. Robert Sarvis, a Libertarian, finished a distant third with 6.5 percent.
McAuliffe's inaguration as Virginia's 72nd governor is scheduled on Jan. 11, 2014.
McAuliffe, a wealthy businessman and noted political fundraiser, was co-chairman of President Bill Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign. He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005 and chairman of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2008. In 2009, McAuliffe unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Virginia governor.
McAuliffe was born in Syracuse, N.Y., on Feb. 9, 1957. He has a bachelor's degree from The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. McAuliffe has lived in Fairfax County for more than 20 years, is married and has five children.
 ","McAuliffe said, ""When I became governor, I inherited a large deficit. … We just turned that into the largest surplus in Virginia history."" The simple fact is that McAuliffe inherited balanced budget proposals from McDonnell. Perhaps, as the governor’s spokesman suggests, McDonnell should have seen approaching clouds and proposed a more conservative spending plan. But that’s hindsight and financial projections are tricky. When McAuliffe sensed an economic slowdown during his first weeks in office, he made a modest $140 million cut to McDonnell’s revenue forecast. Six months later, McAuliffe was projecting a $2.4 billion shortfall. McAuliffe is hardly the first governor to accuse his predecessor of leaving behind a financial mess. But evidence shows the brunt of the economic slowdown, though not McAuliffe’s fault, occurred during his watch. This year’s $550 million surplus is a state record in terms of raw dollars, although not in inflation-adjusted dollars. But the surplus does not mean there’s been a record turnaround in Virginia’s economy. It means that the revenue shortfall is turning out not to be as steep as projected in 2014.

Terry McAuliffe,"Virginia is ""the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars.""","Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, was elected governor of Virginia on Nov. 5, 2013. He received 47.8 percent of the vote in defeating Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who came in at 45.2 percent. Robert Sarvis, a Libertarian, finished a distant third with 6.5 percent.
McAuliffe's inaguration as Virginia's 72nd governor is scheduled on Jan. 11, 2014.
McAuliffe, a wealthy businessman and noted political fundraiser, was co-chairman of President Bill Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign. He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005 and chairman of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2008. In 2009, McAuliffe unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Virginia governor.
McAuliffe was born in Syracuse, N.Y., on Feb. 9, 1957. He has a bachelor's degree from The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. McAuliffe has lived in Fairfax County for more than 20 years, is married and has five children.
 ","McAuliffe, in his maiden address to the General Assembly, said Virginia is ""the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars."" The governor’s office backs the statement by citing statistics showing Virginia is tops in receiving federal contracts. But McAuliffe, in his speech, never defined his terms and federal dollars come to states in many ways, including salaries, grants and payments for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. When it’s all put together, the most current data ranks Virginia sixth in receipt of federal funds and second when the largesse is broken down to an average per citizen. We don’t dispute McAuliffe’s gist that Virginia’s economy heavily relies on federal spending, but he illustrated his point with inartfully. Virginia leads the nation in receiving a few types of payments from Washington. Overall, Virginia is near the top of the list, but it’s not No. 1.

The most recent data from the Department of Corrections cover two years and the rate is 42 percent. The most recent study to look at a three-year period, which covered inmates released in 2004, put the rate at 54 percent. 
The only way to get above 60 percent is to use the older study and look at an entirely different category: the number of ex-convicts who were brought back to the ACI because they had been charged with a new crime or with violating their probation. But that percentage is flawed as well because it includes at least some people who would never have seen a jail cell if they had been able to afford bail. 
Metts offered his ""over 60 percent"" as a definitive statistic. It's not. Although most of the measures we saw offered a lower number, those studies only followed the former inmates for three years or less, an artificial cutoff that makes it easier to collect statistics yet doesn't reflect the fact that anyone who goes back to prison after three years is still regarded as a recidivist.

Sarah Eckhardt,Says Travis County's unemployment rate is below the national average while its poverty rate exceeds the national average--and local poverty is rising.,"Sarah Eckhardt, a lawyer, is a former assistant county attorney. She initially won election to the Travis County Commissioners Court in 2006 and in 2014 won election as the Travis County judge.
","
A Travis County commissioner who may bid in 2014 to succeed Sam Biscoe as county judge suggests conditions are tough locally despite ""present prosperity.""

In a Feb. 18, 2013, email blast, Sarah Eckhardt called for reversing ""our rising poverty,"" after writing: ""Our unemployment rate is below the national average, yet our poverty rate exceeds the national average.""

That’s a three-part claim: Is unemployment below the rest of the nation? Does the county’s poverty rate exceed the national rate--and is local poverty rising?

Unemployment

Eckhardt, a Democrat, told us by email that Travis County’s December 2012 unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, meaning that was the share of adults who did not have a job, had actively looked for work in the prior four weeks and were available for work. That was less than the Texas rate of 6.1 percent, Eckhardt said, and the U.S. rate of 7.8 percent.

Those state and national rates, she cautioned, were adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations such as changes in weather, harvests, major holidays and school schedules. The county’s rate was not adjusted, Eckhardt noted.

By email, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist advised against comparing seasonally adjusted and unadjusted unemployment rates. Cheryl Abbot also said that the unadjusted December 2012 national unemployment rate was 7.6 percent when the Travis County rate was 4.9 percent.

At our request, Abbot provided a chart showing Travis County’s unemployment rate and the national rate from 2009 through 2012. The county unadjusted unemployment rate consistently was less than the national rate, the chart shows. The county experienced its highest rate, 7.3 percent, in January 2010, the same month the national rate topped out at 10.6 percent.

So, the county’s jobless rate has been lower than the national  one.

 Poverty

In 2011, Eckhardt said, Travis County and Texas had identical 18 percent poverty rates, according to the 2011 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, while the national poverty rate was 16 percent.

As noted in a Dec. 16, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, poverty rates can vary by subgroups. That story says that according to 2011 bureau surveys, 23 percent of Travis County’s school-age children lived in poverty. The story says the 2011 child poverty rate ranged in neighboring counties from 10 percent in Williamson County to 21 percent in Bastrop County. Nationally, 21 percent of children lived in poverty that year, the story says.

Eckhardt provided a chart, which she described as coming from a county presentation drawing on the bureau’s surveys, indicating the county’s poverty rate was as low as 12.5 percent in 2000, but escalated to 15.7 percent in 2005 before dipping to 14.7 percent in 2007 and then increasing for three years to 19.2 percent in 2010. 
We did not find that report. But the county’s December 2012 ""Travis County Snapshot"" report, drawing on the census surveys, says 192,436 county residents lived in poverty in 2011, down from 194,156 residents in poverty in 2010, but more than the 163,690 impoverished residents in 2009.

Next, with help from bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, we confirmed that the county had a greater share of low-income residents than the nation in 2011 when the federal poverty level for a family of four was about $23,000.

For a longer view, we checked annual poverty rates for the county, Texas and the nation from 2000 through 2011 based on the bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, which combine data from administrative records, results from the once-a-decade census and more recent population estimates and the bureau’s household surveys to ""provide consistent and reliable single-year estimates,"" the agency says. 
Estimated Poverty Rates (Percentage of Population) 
Source: Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Feb. 20, 2013) 
The county’s poverty rate was around the same as or less than the national rate from 2000 through 2002, but the county rate exceeded the national rate starting in 2003 when the county rate was 13.9 percent and the national rate was 12.5 percent, according to the estimates.

The county’s rate went up and down over the 11 years, escalating from 9.9 percent in 2000 to 15.5 percent in 2005, then dropping three straight years to 14.4 percent in 2009 before increasing to 18.8 percent in 2010--before dipping to 18.1 percent in 2011, when the national rate was 15.9 percent.

So, the county poverty rate exceeds the national rate, though the county rate decreased from 2010 to 2011, the year of the latest available rate. 
After we posted this fact check, a Texas expert objected, saying that the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates were too close for anyone to conclude poverty went down between years. Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst with the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, also said the drop in the raw estimated number of residents in poverty--as shown in the county’s snapshot report on the 2011 American Community Survey--was likewise too slight to be statistically certain.

By our eyes, the margins of error in the 2011 and 2009-11 survey results mean that about 179,000 to 206,000 residents were in poverty in 2011, compared with 176,000 to 188,000 residents in 2009-11.

Phew.

Castro said that ""when surveys require several years’ worth of data in order to be statistically significant, you can’t isolate year-to-year trends – they all get smoothed out in the averages.  That’s why looking at long-term trends, like over a decade, are more helpful.  They tell you what’s changing (or not changing) in the underlying nature of an area’s economy that really improves or worsens residents’ quality of life.""

Separately, we ran Castro’s point about comparing the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates past the Census Bureau. Wes Basel, chief of its Small Area Estimates Branch, agreed by email that the 2011-2010 difference in the county’s estimated poverty rate is ""not large enough to be statistically significant,"" though he said comparisons of the county’s 2011 estimated rate to estimates for 2005 through 2010 are statistically significant; those estimated rates mostly went up in the intervening years, though there were dips, too.

Eckhardt, standing by her claim, earlier noted the near doubling in the county’s poverty rate since 2000. ""The year-to-year snapshot is not nearly as interesting as the"" longer timeframe, she said.

Our ruling

Eckhardt said the county’s unemployment rate is below the national average, yet its poverty rate exceeds the national average--and local poverty is rising.

The local jobless rate has consistently trailed the national rate and the county’s poverty rate has exceeded the national rate since 2003. 
The county’s poverty rate dipped from 2010 to 2011, though that dip was not statistically significant. Also, the 2011 rate of 18.1 percent was nearly double the rate in 2000, so it looks like poverty has risen over the years. Then again, Eckhardt's statement does not acknowledge that the county rate has oscillated year to year, sometimes going down. It's not been a steady rise.

Facebook posts,"Says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history,"" because it's actually risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years.""","Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","UPDATE, May 31, 2012 While we have already shared some of the critiques of this fact-check in a previous follow-up story, critics have since noted that two of our fellow fact checkers -- the Washington Post Fact Checker and the Associated Press -- offered more negative rulings on related claims. The Fact Checker addressed the apparent discrepancy succinctly in a follow-up column, saying ""we did not evaluate the same thing."" Nutting attributed spending from the first year of every presidential term to the previous administration, arguing that every new president starts their term four months into a fiscal year begun under their predecessor. Historically, this has not been a particularly controversial approach, and even some of Nutting’s critics we spoke to agreed that it’s not a bad rule of thumb. But fiscal year 2009 was special because it came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. Nutting did take these factors into account, but not to the extent that some critics think is needed. Nutting shifted $140 billion in fiscal 2009 spending from two of Obama’s signature programs -- the economic stimulus package and an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- out of Bush’s column and into Obama’s. He also shifted excess spending beyond what Bush would have spent from the appropriations bills signed by Obama in 2009. A number of critics also argued that spending for the Troubled Asset Relief Program should be taken into account. This program aided troubled financial institutions and involved a lot of money going out the door in fiscal 2009 and a lot of money coming in the door in subsequent years as the money was paid back to the treasury. The critics note that counting the TARP expenses as Bush’s artificially raises the baseline level of spending Obama inherited, thereby making Obama’s subsequent spending increases seem unrealistically small. We think reasonable people can disagree on which president should be responsible for TARP spending, but to give the critics their say, we’ll include it in our alternative calculation. So, combining the fiscal 2009 costs for programs that are either clearly or arguably Obama’s -- the stimulus, the CHIP expansion, the incremental increase in appropriations over Bush’s level and TARP -- produces a shift from Bush to Obama of between $307 billion and $456 billion, based on the most reasonable estimates we’ve seen critics offer. That’s quite a bit larger than Nutting’s $140 billion, but by our calculations, it would only raise Obama’s average annual spending increase from 1.4 percent to somewhere between 3.4 percent and 4.9 percent. That would place Obama either second from the bottom or third from the bottom out of the 10 presidents we rated, rather than last. When we encounter a compound claim such as this one, we consider the accuracy of each part separately. During our internal discussions, we give a preliminary rating to each half of a claim, then average them to produce our final, published rating.

As for whether 2011 was the best job-producing year since 2005, he’s right if you’re counting private-sector jobs, and slightly off if you’re counting all jobs. 
In 2011, the number of private-sector jobs rose by about 1.83 million (if you count from the January amount to the December amount) or 1.92 million (if you count from December to December). Either way, the increase in 2011 represented the highest one-year total since 2005, when the number of private-sector jobs increased by either 2.22 million or 2.31 million, depending on the time period used. 
If you use total jobs, the increase in 2011 was the biggest since 2006, not 2005. But here too, that’s not the measure Obama used, so we won’t consider it in our rating. 
Finally, there's another dimension. In his remarks, Obama described the damage to the economy, including losing millions of jobs ""before our policies were in full effect."" Then he describes the subsequent job increases.

Then he describes the subsequent job increases. This suggests that he’s taking a degree of credit for the job growth, which runs counter to the reality that no mayor or governor or president deserves all the blame or all the credit for changes in employment.

Robert Gibbs,"""There are no earmarks"" in the stimulus bill.","Robert Gibbs served as White House press secretary for President Barack Obama. He now is a Democratic consultant.
","When the House bill was being considered, it had controversial elements such as money for improvements to the National Mall, which some people consider an earmark. But that was stripped out before final passage. Matthew Specht, a spokesman for Rep. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who is considered the biggest critic of earmarks in the House, told us, ""Yeah, we agree that the House version can probably be considered earmark-free."" There seems to be more earmarking in the Senate version, however. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., has highlighted many provisions he considers to be earmarks, including a $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers. It would allow large Hollywood studios the opportunity to choose between an existing tax break or write off 50 percent of the entire production cost for movies and TV shows made in 2009. It was in the bill when Gibbs made his statement but was removed Feb. 3 when Coburn passed an amendment 52-45 to remove it. To answer whether that project and others could be considered earmarks, we turned to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington advocacy group that tracks government spending and highlights waste. Steve Ellis, the group's vice president, said congressional leaders had generally resisted the urge to fill the bill with earmarks, according to the strict definitions of the word. But he said there still were some projects in the bills that he and other people would consider earmarks. ""There’s at least a few and I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up finding more,"" he said, citing the provision for Filipino veterans as an example. Coburn spokesman John Hart and Taxpayers for Common Sense also cited another project as an earmark: a provision in the bill calling for $2 billion for a ""near zero emissions powerplant."" They say the money is intended to restart FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that is supported by Sen. Dick Durbin. Senators are also employing a  wink-wink  approach that uses vague-sounding language in a committee report to quietly direct money to pet projects. Although the language does not sound specific, groups that track earmarks say it's clear where senators want the money to go. For example,  a report on the bill  from the Senate Appropriations Committee specifies $70 million for ""supercomputer activities, especially as they relate to climate research."" The  Senate Conservatives Fund,  a political action committee, says that is probably targeted for the National Center for Environmental Prediction in Camp Springs, Md.  The group also cites $250 million that is designated ""to repair NASA facilities damaged by Hurricane Ike and to reduce the significant backlog of maintenance and repair projects at NASA facilities nationwide."" That appears to be for the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Those projects don't have senators' names attributed to them, but the Senate Conservatives Fund points out that senators on the Appropriations Committee include Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. It's worth noting that Obama's observation about the overall nature of the bill is mostly correct. The House and Senate stimulus bills have not been stuffed with hundreds of pet projects the way that highway, energy and water bills often are. And that's especially true for the House bill. But the Senate version includes at least several projects that we consider to be earmarks. The Filipino project might not fit the narrow definition of earmarks that Congress or OMB uses, but we think reasonable people would consider it to be an earmark. And the movie industry tax break, which was in the bill when Gibbs made his statement, and the Texas and Maryland projects sure look like earmarks by any definition.

Winsome Earle-Sears,"“The Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 (last year) … to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system.”","Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, was elected Virginia's lieutenant governor in 2021. She is the first Black woman to be elected to statewide office in Virginia.

Sears served in the U.S. Marines from 1983 to 1986. She represented Virginia Beach in the House of Delegates from 2002 to 2004 but did not seek reelection, opting to launch an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House of Repesentatives in 2004. ","Earle-Sears said, ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 — that’s real money, that’s going-to-jail money — to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system.""  Earle-Sears has a little ground beneath her. In 2020, the school system paid a consultant $34,167 to conduct seminars for senior officials on critical race theory and equity training.  But her statement is otherwise tenuous. The seminars were a slice of $422,500 Loudoun spent to improve racial equity in its school amid reports that disproportionate numbers of Black students were being suspended or expelled. The money was spent from September 2018 to June 2020 — not last year as Earle-Sears says. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears recently told Fox News that critical race theory ""is definitely being taught in some form or fashion,"" in Virginia’s public schools. ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 — that’s real money, that’s going-to-jail money — to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system,"" Earle-Sears, a Republican, said in a Jan. 17 interview.  Critical race theory — a 45-year-old academic construct about systemic bias and privilege — has become a political flashpoint across the nation. It holds that racism is part of a broader pattern in America: It is woven into laws, and it shows up in who gets a job interview, the sort of home loans people are offered, how they are treated by police and other facets of daily life large and small. There is a movement by some educators to incorporate critical race theory into instruction, particularly in U.S. history which they say has been taught from a white vantage point. Conservatives in Virginia and across the nation have strongly opposed teaching the theory, saying because the approach focuses on race, it is fundamentally racist. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said in his campaign last fall that the theory has infiltrated Virginia schools and vowed to end its spread. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 15, Youngkin signed an executive order banning ""the use"" of critical race theory.  He has set up a hotline for parents to report the teaching of the theory and other ""divisive practices"" in schools. Critics say there is no evidence the theory is being widely taught in Virginia and Youngkin and his supporters have struggled to provide proof. We asked Earle-Sears’ office for the source of her claim about Loudoun’s $300,000 investment in critical race theory and were sent two news articles: Both articles refer to money Loudoun paid The Equity Collaborative, a California-based consulting group, to interview students, parents and teachers and make recommendations on how the racial atmosphere and policies in schools could be improved.  The Collaborative was paid $422,500 between September 2018 and June 2020, according to county records. No payments were made to the consultant last year, as Earle-Sears claimed.   There’s much debate over the contention of Earle-Sears and others that the money was spent ""to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system."" Wayde Byard, spokesman for Loudoun schools, told us the county paid $34,167 in June 2020 for seminars on critical race theory. He said the purpose was to familiarize senior officials with the theory and that no additional money was spent on CRT. Loudoun Superintendent Scott Ziegler says the theory is not being taught to students. He says critics are conflating the theory with Loudoun’s efforts to bring equity to the way students are treated in school, where most of the money was spent. The Collaborative charged the county $242,000 to interview students, parents and teachers about the racial climate in schools and what could make them more welcoming to minorities. The consultants were paid for conducting equity leadership seminars designed to help teachers relate to minorities, as well as travel. Loudoun’s school system has seen huge growth and demographic change in recent decades. It is no longer majority White. The system began its equity work amid reports that found Black students were being inordinately suspended and expelled. The Collaborative released a 28-page report in June 2019 that did not mention critical race theory. It concluded that Loudoun teachers and principals had a ""low level of racial consciousness,"" discipline of Black students was disproportionately severe and that many minority students encountered racial slurs and violent actions from other students. Based on the findings, Loudoun drew up a 22-page ""Plan to Combat Systemic Racism."" It called for teacher training in racial literacy and competence, a ban on students wearing Confederate flag items and the development of alternative punishments to suspension and expulsion, which are shown to severely harm student outcomes.  While Loudoun draws a distinction between critical race theory and its equity program, critics of the school system do not. ""They’re using semantics, the other side is, when it comes to CRT and it’s definitely being taught in some form or another,"" Earle-Sears told Fox News. Earle-Sears said, ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 — that’s real money, that’s going-to-jail money — to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system.""  Earle-Sears has a little ground beneath her.

 ","McAuliffe says, ""Every single Petersburg school was accredited when I left office,"" implying there was a turnaround in the city’s scholastic performance during his time as governor. He’s dead wrong if you look at the end of his term in January 2018, when none of the city’s public schools was fully accredited by the state based on standardized testing, three were denied accreditation, and three were partially certified. There’s a one-year lag in Virginia’s school accreditation, however, and McAuliffe’s campaign says he was referring to 2019 ratings that reflected Petersburg's academic performance from a year earlier, when McAuliffe left office. It’s a credible argument that McAuliffe should be judged on the 2019 rates, but it’s also highly advantageous to him because standards were eased that year and no Virginia public school was denied accreditation.  Two of Petersburg’s six schools were fully accredited in 2019, while 92% of schools across the state met that ideal. The other four were conditionally accredited, meaning they were performing below standards in at least one area and were required to take corrective actions. They were among the worst-performing 7% of Virginia schools. So there are problems with McAuliffe’s claim, even when we give him the advantage of using the 2019 ratings. By saying all Petersburg schools were accredited - and deftly avoiding the distinction between fully and conditionally accredited - he creates a misleading impression of the city’s progress during his term.

Facebook posts,“Police training in Wisconsin is 21 weeks. A cosmetology license takes 40 weeks.”,"Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","A widely-shared Facebook post in the aftermath of Blake’s shooting by Kenosha police said: ""Police training in Wisconsin is 21 weeks. A cosmetology license takes 40 weeks."" When you look only at training, cosmetologists are required to put in more time than police officers. The numbers in the Facebook post are slightly off and actually understate the gap, but the underlying point still stands.  That said, the post doesn’t account for the additional education requirements needed to become a police officer, nor the assessments they must undergo before they even begin training. That leaves us with a statement that’s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Police are under a national microscope after a Kenosha officer repeatedly shot a Black man in the back.  A video of the Aug. 23, 2020, incident circulated widely on social media appeared to show a Kenosha police officer grabbing Jacob Blake by the back of his shirt as he tried to get into a small SUV before an officer shot Blake seven times at point-blank range. Three of Blake’s children were in the vehicle.  The shooting, which paralyzed Blake from the waist down, provoked protests in Kenosha and across the country over police brutality and its disproportionate impact on Black people. It also renewed criticism of police departments, which some say are overfunded and do not adequately train officers.  An Aug. 24, 2020, Facebook post shared more than 1,300 times underscored that message. ""Police training in Wisconsin is 21 weeks,"" the post said. ""A cosmetology license takes 40 weeks."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is the post correct about the imbalance? In Wisconsin, both police officers and cosmetologists must undergo training before they can assume the job. But the processes are very different. According to the state Department of Safety and Professional Services, applicants for a cosmetology license must complete at least 1,550 hours — or about 39 weeks if you assume 40 hours per week — of training at a licensed cosmetology school. The program must last a minimum of 10 months.  Alternatively, aspiring cosmetologists can take two to four years to complete at least 4,000 hours of practical training and theoretical instruction through an apprenticeship. They must also have a high school diploma or the equivalent of one.  Approved candidates must then pass a practical and written exam, which can take up to 6.5 hours altogether. Those who succeed and meet all other requirements receive a license.  So, depending which measure you use, the Facebook post is either about right or vastly understated the amount of time required to obtain a cosmetology license.  It also doesn’t tell the full story about police training. As of 2016, anyone who applies to be a law enforcement officer or tribal law enforcement officer in Wisconsin must undergo 720 hours, or 18 weeks, of training — even less than what the Facebook post claimed. The training curriculum for jail and juvenile detention officers is 160 hours. According to a document from multiple statewide law enforcement groups, the 720-hour academy includes written exams, 40 hours of scenario-based evaluations and training on ethics, cultural competency and racial sensitivity.  However, training is only one part of the puzzle. Unlike cosmetologists, law enforcement officials employed after 1993, excluding jail and juvenile officers, must have an associate’s degree or at least 60 accredited college credits -- or attain one within five years. They must also undergo a medical assessment, background check, oral interview and drug test.  The Facebook post doesn’t factor in the degree requirement, which is a key difference in this comparison. Cosmetology training can begin right out of high school, while police officers typically would first complete at least a two-year degree. The post also doesn’t acknowledge the 24 hours of annual training officers must undergo to remain in law enforcement. Cosmetologists, by contrast, are no longer required to participate in continuing education and must read a digest of rule changes that occurred during the biennium when they renew their license. The Facebook poster did not respond to a request for comment. A widely-shared Facebook post in the aftermath of Blake’s shooting by Kenosha police said: ""Police training in Wisconsin is 21 weeks.

Several observers of Los Angeles politics and education said Villaraigosa doesn’t get all the credit but did play an outsized role. He helped elect a reform-minded school board, install a superintendent and created a nonprofit that took control of and helped improve the district’s worst performing schools. The dispute over the district’s view of its graduation rate is missing from Villaraigosa’s statement.

Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55’s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate.

","Kelly said in a span of about three days, a small group of black students forced the resignations of two top administrators at the University of Missouri. Multiple press reports and interviews with members of the Mizzou community tell us Kelly’s shorthand falls short on several key points. Deans, graduate students, and faculty had been pressing for the ouster of Loftin for at least a month prior to his departure. It is no small matter for deans to make such a demand and they did so three times in early October. Loftin’s problems with the university community go back well into the beginning of the semester. There’s more support for the role of black students in the removal of Wolfe. The evidence tells us that pressure from black students was the driving force and the momentum shifted rapidly against him when a student went on a hunger strike on Nov. 2. However, anger had been growing since mid October and a much larger number of people from across the university community joined the call for Wolfe to step down.

A rough estimate for the top-25 hedge fund managers shows they collectively earned $11.62 billion in 2014, and that was a bad year. In 2013, they earned approximately $21.15 billion.

Greg Abbott,"A 2011 measure passed into law with Wendy Davis’ support ""removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like"" the school funding case.","Greg Abbott won election as governor of Texas in November 2014, carrying 59 percent of the vote. Abbott was re-elected in 2018. Abbott, a former member of the Texas Supreme Court, served three terms as the state's attorney general before being succeeded by Ken Paxton in early 2015.","Given an opportunity, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis pressed Republican Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, about his office continuing to battle school districts in court despite a state district judge ruling the school finance system to be both underfunded and unconstitutional. ""The only thing right now coming between our children and appropriate funding of their schools today is you,"" Davis asserted in the pair's Sept. 19, 2014, debate in the Rio Grande Valley. ""On behalf of the 5 million children of this state, will you agree tonight that you will drop your appeals and allow our schools to be appropriately funded?"" Abbott responded by blaming legislators, including Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, for limiting his options. ""Sen. Davis,"" Abbott replied, ""there is actually another thing coming between me and settling that lawsuit. And that is a law that you voted on and helped pass in 2011 that removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like this."" Did legislators including Davis move to keep the attorney general from settling lawsuits? We started this fact check by asking the Abbott campaign for elaboration. Spokeswoman Amelia Chasse pointed to a proposal that won legislative approval in 2011, with Davis among supporters. Then again, it came clear, the legislative leash on the attorney general’s ability to settle cases originated in 2007 action -- more than a year before Davis won her first Senate term. The 2007 law said the attorney general must get legislative approval/consent to settle matters with damages costing the state more than $25 million. The 2011 change lowered the threshold to $10 million. Resolving the school-finance matter would surely cost more than either limit. In 2013 and again in August 2014, state District Judge John Dietz of Austin ruled against the state in the case, though he also gave lawmakers until July 2015 to act. At the time of the Davis-Abbott debate, state lawyers overseen by Abbott were expected to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court (which they did a few days later). By email, David Thompson, a lawyer representing hundreds of districts in the litigation, told us either settlement threshold -- $10 million or the previous $25 million -- ""would be substantially below what it will take to resolve the school finance lawsuit."" Meantime, former state Sen. Steve Ogden, who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and authored the settlement thresholds that passed into law, told us by phone that Abbott can’t settle the school case without the Legislature’s permission ""because it’s going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to do it."" He and Rep. Tryon Lewis, R-Odessa, chairman of the House Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committee, were guided to us by Chasse. Both said the 2011 action effectively toughened and arguably reaffirmed the original restriction. Here are the details behind the legislation leashing the attorney general’s power: In 2007, according to legislative records, Ogden, R-Bryan, won passage of Senate Bill 2031,which required legislative consent or approval of the settlement or compromise of a claim or action against the state involving state expenditures exceeding $25 million. Specifically, the law barred the attorney general or any lawyer representing the state from entering into a settlement of a claim without legislative consent or approval. The new law said this limit applies if the settlement requires the state to pay damages exceeding the $25 million in a biennium or if it ""commits this state to a course of action that in reasonable probability will entail a continuing increased expenditure of state funds over subsequent"" two-year periods, which strikes us as sweeping in a possible resolution of the school suit. In May 2007, very few legislators objected to Ogden’s proposal as it headed toward Gov. Rick Perry. A  House Democrat voted ""no"" in that body’s final vote and three Democratic senators cast ""no"" votes when the Senate later agreed to House amendments. Four years later, with Davis in the Senate, lawmakers and Perry signed off on Senate Bill 899, reducing the dollar threshold for legislative involvement. An accompanying analysis, by the in-house Senate Research Center, said: ""In keeping with increased scrutiny of state expenditures, this bill would lower the threshold settlement amount requiring legislative approval from $25 million to $10 million."" Senators including Davis unanimously advanced the reduction to the House, where it won approval with one Republican voting ""no."" To recap: Davis was not in the Legislature when lawmakers initially limited the attorney general’s ability to settle cases. She was a member of the Senate that approved a toughening. We asked Abbott’s office to explain how, day to day, the limit has been applied to cases. A spokesman, Jerry Strickland, replied after we initially published this fact check, saying by email: ""Procedurally, when a settlement may implicate the statute, the opposing party is notified that any settlement reached will be subject to legislative approval. The terms of the settlement are negotiated before the settlement is brought to the Legislature. The Legislature can then approve, reject or request modifications to a settlement.""  We also asked about the attorney general’s biennial reports to lawmakers on such settlements; such reports were required by the 2007 law. Each biennium, Strickland said, the agency ""provides privileged attorney-client communications concerning potential settlements requiring legislative approval.

But this is outweighed by a long list of omissions -- and it doesn’t reflect Scott’s complete tenure. The first problem is it glosses over the fact that the cut took place in 2011, and was later followed by increases. In addition, it is an overstatement to suggest that ""thousands"" of teachers lost their jobs due to the 2011 state budget cuts. Statewide data shows the number of teachers dropped by about 1,405, but that includes departures for any reason, not just layoffs. The percentage of class sizes out of compliance with the mandate increased by about 1 percentage point between Crist’s last budget and Scott’s first budget.

He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005 and chairman of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2008. In 2009, McAuliffe unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Virginia governor.
McAuliffe was born in Syracuse, N.Y., on Feb. 9, 1957. He has a bachelor's degree from The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. McAuliffe has lived in Fairfax County for more than 20 years, is married and has five children.
 ","McAuliffe says Cuccinelli would ""take away money from public schools to pay for private schools."" Cuccinelli’s K-12 plan opens that possibility by proposing tax credits for the parents of children in failing public schools to defray their cost of switching to private education. The program, if passed by the General Assembly, would have enormous symbolic meaning because it would crack Virginia’s tradition of not directly aiding private schools. McAuliffe’s statement, however, lacks perspective. It doesn’t note that Cuccinelli’s program would be very small. This year, only six of Virginia’s 1,828 public schools are failing. They are attended by 3,335 of the state’s 1.27 million students. In the unlikely scenario that every failing-school parent switched their children to private schools, Cuccinelli’s tax credit would have cost about $16.9 million this year -- one-third of 1 percent of the state’s public education budget. Cuccinelli says he would not cut the K-12 budget to pay for his plan. But in the long run under other governors, the revenues available to fund public education would be reduced -- very marginally -- to support the private school tax break.

But it’s on the mark for schools, which would have a 20-day window in which to administer tests to different students within the school. In fact, schools generally expect to focus on little else besides testing procedures for that time period. The current FCAT tests work the same way, but that testing window is shorter, at 12 days.

To get there, the two relied on articles citing research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which found that of recent bachelor’s degree earners -- those under 25 -- 53.6 percent were either jobless or underemployed. 
There are two factors for us in issuing our rating: 
1) How big of a mistake was it for Gaetz and Weatherford to say ""last year’s U.S. college graduates"" when the study looked at all bachelor’s degree earners under 25, a time frame that would span beyond 2012? And; 
2) How big of a difference is it for Gaetz and Weatherford to use ""unemployed"" when ""jobless"" might have been better? 
On the first question, it’s likely that the statistics would be different by looking just at 2012 graduates compared to a longer period of time (that data isn’t available). 
On the second, economists we talked to said it’s commonplace for people to interchange ""jobless"" and ""unemployed,"" though some experts would argue they mean different things. While we don’t quibble with Weatherford and Gaetz using the term unemployed, it’s important to note in this particular context that researchers looked beyond people unable to find work and included people who were not looking for work.

The former state senator from Pasadena unsuccessfully sought the 2014 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor.
","Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking a third term this November, refers to the the state’s oil-soaked history in a recent column extolling renewable energy. In his article, published Tuesday in the Austin American-Statesman, Patterson writes: “We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.” Even though oil production has been declining, state revenue from oil and gas is the tops? When we sought background, the General Land Office shared a chart showing state oil and gas income reached a historical high of $495 million in 1982 that wasn't exceeded until 2008, when it hit $533 million. The state's oil-and-gas-related proceeds dropped to $381 million in 2009, the land office says. Counting revenue during the first seven months of this fiscal year, we calculate it will reach $279 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year Aug. 31. Total state take during Patterson's seven-plus years as commissioner: $2.7 billion. And when did oil production peak? According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which tracks in-state oil production, the peak year for crude oil production was 1972 when more than 167,000 wells produced nearly 1.3 billion barrels. As of 2007, production had ebbed to about 336 million barrels. In 2008, production increased for the first time since 1991 to more than 346 million barrels, before falling in 2009, according to the commission. R.J. DeSilva, spokesperson for the State Comptroller's office, offered this analysis for the surge in state income from oil and gas surged well after oil production peaked: ""Oil and natural gas production are taxed on the value of oil and natural gas that’s produced. Oil and natural gas prices were higher in the early ‘80s than in the ‘70s (and reached all time highs in 2008)."" So how does Patterson’s statement shake out? He gets the peak-production timing right; it was the '70s. But he's off in saying state government is making more than ever from oil and gas ""right now."" That was true for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2008, but in 2009 state oil and gas revenue fell 29 percent from the year before and it's on pace to register another decline this fiscal year.

It does appear some voter registration applicants have been sent to people who have died, and a nefarious person could attempt to register a dead person to vote.

They compare that personal information with potential matches in other databases of people who have died.

Larry Elder,"“California voters to be able to download ballots at home for recall election, sparking security concerns.”",Larry Elder is a Republican candidate in the California gubernatorial recall election and conservative radio talk show host.,"Republican recall candidate Larry Elder recently suggested, without evidence, that there are concerns about the security of a California voting program known as remote accessible vote-by-mail.  He also promoted the idea that some voters could download ballots. That part is correct, but needs context: RABVM allows people with disabilities along with military and overseas voters to download a ballot before submitting it by mail or in-person. State lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded the program each of the past two years to allow all registered voters to use it. A small fraction of voters used it in 2020. The second part of the tweet Elder shared, about security concerns, is just plain wrong. Election and disability rights experts, along with California’s Secretary of State’s Office, say there’s no evidence showing the program is a security risk. It is subject to the same fraud protections as California’s traditional vote-by-mail program.  Registered voters must apply to use it. Once approved, they use a unique access code to download, complete and print out their ballot. The ballot cannot be submitted online.  Voters are required to sign the outside of their ballot envelope. County elections officials then match that signature with the ones on file to verify each ballot.  Elder’s campaign did not respond to a request for evidence to support the claim about security concerns. The article he tweeted out doesn’t include anyone raising concerns about the remote voter program.  ",Chris Nichols,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/27/larry-elder/no-calif-program-voters-disabilities-not-security-/,barely-true

It will be up to the court to decide whether to count that ballot.  It is possible that boards of election do not catch every instance of a voter dying after they cast their ballot but before Election Day.

Mark Pocan,"Says Donald Trump's claim that ""there was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our country, a person is innocent"" directly contradicts Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s statement.","Mark Pocan was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2nd Congressional District on Nov. 6, 2012. He is from Madison and previously served as a Democratic member of the Wisconsin state Assembly. ","Pocan said Trump’s response to Mueller — that there was ""insufficient evidence"" and therefore Trump is innocent — is ""in direct contradiction"" to what Mueller said. Mueller did use the term ""insufficient evidence,"" but that was in a generic reference to proof of a broad conspiracy involving Russian election interference. Trump’s tweet treats that statement as a commentary on his own guilt or innocence. In actuality, Mueller was very clear that he cannot charge a sitting president with a crime, and therefore out of fairness couldn’t even accuse him of one. And Mueller was careful to note, ""if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" So Mueller made a vague reference to ""insufficient evidence"" of a conspiracy related to Russian interference. Trump’s tweet, meanwhile, implies a much more specific and far-reaching meaning — that there was no evidence Trump himself committed any crime. Mueller said no such thing. In fact, Mueller addressed a potential interpretation like Trump’s in his comments. ""After that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller said. ""We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime."" What’s more, Mueller said his office didn’t assess whether Trump committed a crime — because it could not issue any such charges against a sitting president anyway. ""Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional,"" Mueller said. ""Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. … It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge."" He went on to refer to impeachment as the only way to address such a matter. ""The (Department of Justice) opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" Mueller said. ""Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime."" Ron Boehmer, a spokesman for Pocan, said the congressman’s tweet was referring to this limitation. ""Special Counsel Mueller did not reference insufficient evidence, but rather a restriction on being able to charge the President and made it very clear that he could not be cleared,"" Boehmer said in an email. So, Pocan’s ""direct contradiction"" claim isn’t exactly cut and dried. Trump did use the same term as Mueller. But it’s clear Trump over-reached in his summary of Mueller’s comments, claiming a level of vindication that Mueller didn’t offer. Pocan said Trump’s response to Mueller — that there was ""insufficient evidence"" and therefore Trump is innocent — is ""in direct contradiction"" to what Mueller said. Mueller did use the term ""insufficient evidence,"" but that was in a generic reference to proof of a broad conspiracy involving Russian election interference.

Marcia Fudge,"Ohio ""thought that our (voting) machines were so awful we got rid of them, but South Carolina bought them. This is true. South Carolina bought all the machines we got rid of because they were not effective.""","
Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Warrensville Heights, is the congresswoman from Ohio's 11th district. Prior to her election to the House of Representatives, she was mayor of Warrensville Heights.
 ","Fudge said that Ohio ""thought that our (voting) machines were so awful we got rid of them but South Carolina bought them. This is true. South Carolina bought all the machines we got rid of, because they were not effective."" Her statement was confusing, and her explanation didn’t clear it up. The state did not buy machines from Ohio. A study commissioned by Ohio found multiple types of equipment were vulnerable from both of those companies. South Carolina continued to use the Election Systems and Software equipment despite the findings. ""Hanging chads"" in punch card machines in Florida in 2000, followed by a recount, led Congress to provide more than $3 billion for states to purchase new voting equipment. In 2004, South Carolina spent $34 million to buy 12,000 iVotronic machines from Election Systems & Software. The machines allowed voters to cast ballots electronically, and they were used statewide starting in 2006. Over the years, counties purchased some additional machines, including some refurbished machines from Florida and Tennessee. But not Ohio. In 2007, the Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner released a 300-plus page review of Ohio's electronic voting technology that also called into question the security of South Carolina’s machines. The researchers evaluated equipment by a few companies that were used in Ohio: Election Systems & Software, Hart InterCivic, and Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold). The study examined multiple vendors because Ohio counties can select their own equipment. The researchers found that all three systems lacked protections to guarantee a trustworthy election and were vulnerable to attacks. ""The security failings of the ES&S system are severe and pervasive,"" they wrote. ""There are exploitable weaknesses in virtually every election device and software module, and we found practical attacks that can be mounted by almost any participant in an election."" The vendors disputed the findings, which set off a debate in Ohio and South Carolina about whether to get rid of electronic voting machines that lacked a complete paper trail. The South Carolina Election Commission said the equipment was secure, and the election officials test it before elections to make sure. That study wasn’t the first red flag about electronic voting equipment in Ohio. In 2006, an elections panel issued a 400-page report that detailed what went wrong leading up to a botched May primary in Cuyahoga County, where it took about a week to count the results. Cuyahoga County, one of Ohio’s largest counties, includes Cleveland which is in Fudge’s district. The report criticized decisions by the county’s top election officials and multiple breakdowns amid a changeover to Diebold electronic machines. Diebold later spun off its election machines to Premier Election Solutions. After vote tabulation problems in November 2007, Cuyahoga ditched the machines. The Ohio study isn’t the only one to raise concerns about electronic voting machines that lack a paper trail. In 2006, a team of computer experts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology reported that they could find no way to verify the accuracy of votes cast on paperless touch-screens. But by then, many states had moved forward with purchasing such equipment. Criticism of such equipment has persisted, including in a recent study by Duncan Buell, a University of South Carolina computer scientist. Fudge appears to have lumped together the electronic voting machines in Ohio and South Carolina. When we asked Fudge’s spokeswoman for her evidence, she said Ohio got rid of Premier Election Solutions. We couldn’t find evidence that Brunner decertified that vendor, but she did sue them and the state won a settlement. But South Carolina didn’t buy equipment from Premier Voting Solutions; it purchased machines from Election Systems & Software. (The company bought Premier Election Solutions in 2009, though it then sold the intellectual property a year later.) ""My statement was meant to convey that South Carolina bought the same type of machines, with the same defects as those in Ohio, and experienced similar problems,"" Fudge told PolitiFact in a statement. The state remains confident in the equipment, commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told us. However, due to the age of the machines, South Carolina plans to buy a new system that will have a paper record of each voter’s ballot. Fudge said that Ohio ""thought that our (voting) machines were so awful we got rid of them but South Carolina bought them. This is true. South Carolina bought all the machines we got rid of, because they were not effective."" Her statement was confusing, and her explanation didn’t clear it up. The state did not buy machines from Ohio. A study commissioned by Ohio found multiple types of equipment were vulnerable from both of those companies.

Erin Forrest,"""75 percent of the town boards in Wisconsin have no women on them at all.""
 ","Erin Forrest is executive director of Emerge Wisconsin, which trains Democratic women to run for public office.
","To balance Vukmir’s appearance on the show, Forrest was interviewed. Emerge Wisconsin, which offers a six-month training program for Democratic women who want to run for office, reported that after the election of Donald Trump, it had its largest group of applicants. Now to Forrest’s claim. The numbers In Wisconsin, a town is the form of local government in areas that are not within the boundaries of cities or villages. About 30 percent of Wisconsin residents live in towns, according to the Wisconsin Towns Association. One of the state’s 1,255 towns, according to the Wisconsin Blue Book, is also a county -- Menominee. It has seven town board members (four women and three men), who also serve as county supervisors, while most town boards have only three members, each of whom are elected to two-year terms. To back her claim, Forrest referred us to a report released in April 2016 on women elected to judicial, executive and legislative offices in Wisconsin at the state and local government levels (including school districts). Current as of 2015, it is the latest edition of a report that is produced every five years by the Wisconsin Women’s Council, a state body whose members are appointed by the governor and legislative leaders. The data was collected by the Research Center for Women and Girls at Alverno College in Milwaukee. The report highlighted two findings in comparing 2015 to the first report, done in 2005: As for town boards, the report found, 75 percent of them had no women -- the same as in 2005. Town boards are the least likely among Wisconsin local governing bodies to have gender diversity, the study found. Women account for only 9 percent of town supervisors (the same as in 2010, but up from 7 percent in 2005). Women were most represented on tribal councils, holding 42 percent of the seats, the same as 2005, and on the state Supreme Court, holding five of the seven seats. Other perspectives Mike Koles, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association, said women are far more represented among town clerks and treasurers, the vast majority of which are elected positions. We looked for any other reports on elected women in Wisconsin, checking with the Wisconsin Towns Association, the Local Government Institute of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin Extension, Wisconsin Women in Government and the Wisconsin Federation of Republican Women, but didn’t find any that were aware of any other data on Wisconsin’s town boards. They don’t bear on this fact check, but we did find other studies that looked more generally at women elected officials in Wisconsin. State Legislature: 31 of the 132 members of the Wisconsin Legislature are women -- with that 23.5 percent slightly below the national rate of 24.8 percent, according to a February 2017 report by the non-profit National Conference of State Legislatures. County to federal: Wisconsin ranked 17th on a measure of representativeness that looked at race and gender among elected officials from the county to federal levels, according to a 2014 national report. It was commissioned by the Women Donors Network, which describes itself as a progressive group of women philanthropists. White women were 42 percent of Wisconsin’s population and comprised 22 percent of elected officials. For women of color, the percentages were 9 percent and 3 percent. Why they don’t run: Women expressed less confidence than men about their ability to run for and hold public office, according to a UW Extension survey of 600 county board supervisors and people identified as potential candidates for local office in 38 Wisconsin counties. The surveys were done in summer 2015 and the results were published in February 2016. Two of the findings: 71 percent of men compared to 60 percent of women said they were well-qualified to run; nearly 19 percent of women said ""making decisions in public"" acted as a barrier to running, while less than 5 percent of men felt that way. Our rating Forrest said: ""75 percent of the town boards in Wisconsin have no women on them at all."" She accurately quotes the most recent Alverno College study, in 2015, of elected women officials in Wisconsin.

First, a minor quibble: the restoration of felon rights under Crist was not automatic because the Clemency Board still had to sign off on it. However our main objection to Gelber’s statement is his claim that Crist was the ""first"" to do this in Florida history. In 1975, Askew and the Cabinet changed the rules to allow for ""automatic restoration"" of rights for voting. Under Askew, the changes broadly applied to offenders, whether they had completed sentences related to violent or nonviolent offenses. Crist’s policy favored nonviolent offenders.

Smith wrote that the election bill ""allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary."" 
The bill does mandate those two changes. But Smith omits that some of those discretionary changes in the bill are a big deal and are expected to change how elections are operated in large counties. Elections supervisors in at least some counties are likely to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day and they are likely to add more early voting sites and go beyond the mandated minimum hours. Plus, we found a few provisions that are not discretionary and would affect voters.

Bill White,Says Gov. Rick Perry is “by far and away the highest-paid state employee on an hourly basis.”,"Bill White, an author, is a San Antonio native who was mayor of Houston from 2004-2009. He was the 2010 Democratic nominee for governor of Texas.
","
White’s campaign cited Perry’s public schedule for January through May and its calculation that Perry accumulated 145.5 hours of scheduled events in the period. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in an e-mail: “We followed (Perry’s) state schedule and counted 1 hour for events, 1/2 hour for phone calls, 1/2 hour for press conferences. Most busy CEOs get in and out and get things done. Church was not counted.” 
Bacon added that she’s heard Mack Brown, head coach of the University of Texas football team, is the highest-paid state employee, “but you can bet he works a lot more than seven hours a week.”
 
We’re not testing Brown’s work ethic, but we’re game for White’s charge, which his campaign based on dividing five months’ of Perry’s $150,000 annual salary—about $62,500—by 146 (rounding up from 145.5 hours of state-scheduled events as listed on his schedule), resulting in an “hourly” pay rate of about $428. 
Made sense for Bacon to mention the UT coach, who’s widely known for having the top salary among state workers, at $5.1 million. Presuming a 40-hour work week, Brown’s hourly rate breaks out to nearly $2,452. Presuming a 60-hour week--head football coaches work notoriously long hours--Brown’s hourly rate drops to nearly $1,635. If Brown improbably worked around the clock, his hourly rate would be $582, still more than the hourly rate White calculates for Perry. 
Another UT coach and the head football coaches at Texas A&M University and Texas Tech University each make $1.5 million or more, as noted in a 2010 chart compiled by the online Texas Tribune listing the highest-paid state workers. Assuming each works 60 hours a week, their salaries translate to hourly rates of $481 or more. 
Then again, the argument is often made that college coaches like Brown, whose salary derives from sports revenues, are in a special category. What about other state employees? 
Separately, we asked the state comptroller’s office to break out the state’s highest-paid workers, including Perry. The agency, citing salary figures as of April, generated a list taking into account about 157,000 state workers, excluding college and university employees, which it does not track. 
The compilation suggests Perry’s annual salary is less than what the state pays 313 other workers, topped by Britt Harris, chief investment officer of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, at $480,000. We called the system and inquired into how many hours Harris works. Spokesman Howard Goldman said “well over 40” hours a week. Assuming Harris works an average of 60 hours weekly, his hourly rate runs about $154. If he’s averaging 50 hours a week, the rate would be about $185. 
Perry’s hourly wage is more than double those amounts, per White’s calculation of his working hours based on events posted on his official schedule. This begs the question: Is the schedule an accurate indicator of how much time Perry spends on the job? 
That’s a toughie because the schedule is far from complete, making it hard for anyone to gauge how the governor spends his time. In 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reviewed the calendars for the state’s top six statewide elected officials covering January through March of that year. The newspaper said that while the officials’ calendars “did not prove to be comprehensive accountings of their working hours, they yielded glimpses of how the officials spent their time.” 
Perry had state-related events on fewer than 40 days during the period, the newspaper reported, counting a parade, a coach's salute and two Washington dinners--and he had no state-scheduled events on 31 weekdays.  
A Perry spokesman at the time, Robert Black, was quoted noting that Perry had just assumed the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association and started promoting his book saluting the Boy Scouts. “Both these events took up a considerable amount of the governor's time,” Black said, “but working hard to elect more conservative governors across the nation and espousing the values and virtues of the Boy Scouts of America is well worth the effort.”  
Of late, Bacon told us in an e-mail, it’s up to Perry to prove he’s been busy with state business in the many hours he did not have scheduled events. She said: “When you're a CEO, you can't have last-minute meetings. Things have to be planned in advance.” 
We didn’t hear back from Perry’s campaign or his state office. But we came across this reaction to the White campaign calculation from Perry, as reported by Hearst Newspapers columnist Peggy Fikac: “If they've made anybody that can outwork me yet, please introduce me to him or her. Texans know I am mobile, I am agile, and I'm going to continue doing work for 'em 24/7. Just because it doesn't show up on my schedule doesn't mean I'm not out working for the people of the state of Texas, thank you very much."" 
Bacon spotted the same Perry reaction, which she termed “truly priceless” in an e-mail. “He is ‘mobile’ and ‘agile?’ What does that have to do with working seven hours a week while drawing a full-time salary? Sounds more like something related to jogging ... and shooting coyotes,” wrote Bacon -- a reference to Perry’s declaration this year that he shot a coyote while jogging. 
Seeking historical perspective, we called chiefs of staff to the governors preceding Perry, George W. Bush and Ann Richards. 
Joe M. Allbaugh, who was Gov. Bush’s chief of staff,  said Bush’s official schedule didn’t reflect his work days, which often ran from early in the morning into evenings, especially if lawmakers were in session. “This is foolish and hogwash for the White campaign to draw this type of comparison,” Allbaugh said. “All public officials put in more hours than they’re paid. It doesn’t matter if you’re Democratic, Republican or Martian, your public service is not for the money.” 
We asked Allbaugh, who backs Perry’s re-election, if it’s possible Perry enjoys a lot of down time. Allbaugh replied: “I don’t know if it’s possible to do that or not. People need to remember, that person is governor full time... Hurricanes, oil spills, they don’t call up (from) 8 to 5 (saying:) ‘By the way, is the governor in?’” 
Next, we reached Austin lobbyist John Fainter, who was a chief of staff for Richards when she was governor and earlier served as secretary of state with Gov. Mark White. Fainter, who has contributed to Perry's campaign kitty, said governors don’t ever get away from work. “Things come up,” Fainter said. “The schedule is largely irrelevant as to the time they actually spend on duties.” 
We get it: Texas governors don’t punch time clocks.  
Where does that leave White’s statement that Perry is “far and away” the highest-paid state worker on an hourly basis? 
For starters, Perry’s hourly wage as calculated by White is less than what we calculated for several state employees (coaches).  
Most importantly, he assumes the public schedule released by Perry’s office accounts for all his working hours. But according to the Statesman’s previous reporting as well as two veterans of the governor’s office, such schedules are woefully incomplete. 
White could have sought a better accounting of how the governor spends his time without cobbling together comparisons that don’t hold up. ",W. Gardner Selby,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/jul/12/bill-white/white-citing-available-schedule-says-perry-far-and/,pants-fire

Buttigieg was elected mayor of South Bend, Ind., in 2011 and was re-elected in 2015. He decided not to seek re-election and his term ended in January 2020. From 2009 to 2017, he served in the U.S. Navy Reserve and was a lieutenant. He received a bachelor’s degree in history and literature from Harvard College and a first-class honors bachelor’s degree in philosophy, politics and economics from Pembroke College as a Rhodes Scholar. He ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primaries.","Buttigieg said that Sanders would ""go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support."" In reality, polling consistently shows that most Democrats do approve of key parts of Sanders’ economic agenda, including single-payer health care, the Green New Deal, tuition-free college, student debt forgiveness, a $15 minimum wage, breaking up big banks, and paid family leave. And for each of those issues except single-payer health care, a more modest percentage of all Americans — but still a majority — signal their support. It’s important to note, however, that support levels by all Americans drop significantly once voters are informed about the policies’ costs, often to majority disapproval. And on health care policy, Buttigieg’s plan — the public option to buy into Medicare — is more popular than Sanders’ single-payer proposal is, both among all voters and among Democrats.

","Gillespie says Warner’s ""record is one of acting against"" the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2012, Warner did oppose a procedural step that would have allowed a Senate vote on expediting the project. He explained that he even though supported the pipeline, he thought it should be part of a broad energy policy. Even so, its reasonable to count this vote as an action against Keystone. But after that, Gillespie’s claim runs into problems. Each party blames the other for the Senate’s failure to pass pro-Keystone legislation this May. Gillespie’s campaign notes that Warner helped block a GOP effort to amend an energy efficiency bill with a go-ahead for Keystone and a provision that would prevented new carbon emission regulations. On the other hand, Warner co-sponsored a clean bill that would have expedited the pipeline. A review of the record shows Warner voted in favor of a Keystone resolution in 2013. He signed two letters to the president and one to the secretary of state asking them to expedite the project. Many environmentalists put Warner squarely in the Keystone crowd.

Jeffrey Grybowski,"Offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy.""","Jeffrey R. Grybowski has been involved with the Deepwater Wind project since 2008, first as an outside lawyer then, as of 2012, chief executive officer. Grybowski formerly was policy director and chief of staff for Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri.
","July 31 was a red letter day for Deepwater Wind, a Providence company that hopes to build the first offshore wind farm in the United States. That was the day Deepwater was announced as the winner of a federal auction to lease space for the farm in a 257-square-mile area of waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts. (The company plans an initial demonstration project of five turbines off Block Island. The larger project would have more than 100 turbines.) It was in that context that Jeffrey R. Grybowski, chief executive officer of Deepwater Wind, appeared Aug. 4, 2013 on the TV public affairs show ""10 News Conference."" Host Bill Rappleye asked Grybowski how much the electricity generated by the turbines would cost. ""Yes, 13- to 14-cent power [offshore wind energy per kilowatt hour] is probably what we’re talking about, significantly lower than the cost of what we’ve seen for offshore wind to date,"" Grybowski said. ""Also, by the way, significantly less expensive than solar energy."" We wondered whether offshore wind is, in fact, cheaper than solar. We started with the state Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Public Utilities Commission, which both have important roles in setting the prices for renewable energy. Deepwater has negotiated with energy distributor National Grid, which is required to buy power from renewable sources, a wholesale price of 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for the five-turbine demonstration project, steadily ranging up to 46.9 cents per kilowatt hour in the last year of a 20-year contract, according to division officials. The demonstration would have a generating capacity of 30 megawatts -- a measure of peak output over an hour. (A megawatt is 1,000 kilowatts. The average U.S. home uses about 940 kilowatt hours per month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.) If the demonstration wind farm, called Phase I, works out as planned, Deepwater Wind expects to move forward on plans to build a large-scale wind farm, called Phase II, in the leased federal waters. Phase II would generate up to 1,000 megawatts -- enough, the company says, to power 350,000 homes. In an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, Grybowski said his comments on ""10 News Conference"" were about Phase II. He predicted that in the coming years, Deepwater will be able to negotiate with National Grid a wholesale price of 13 cents to 14 cents per kilowatt hour, escalating annually over the life of a contract. To check Grybowski’s claim, we first had to determine the price of offshore wind energy. That’s a challenge because no such project has yet been built in the United States. As proof that his 13- to 14-cent-per-kilowatt-hour estimate is realistic, Grybowski pointed to a formal offer by Deepwater in 2012 to sell Phase II energy in New York state for as low as 10 cents per kwh. The closest point of comparison is in nearby Massachusetts, where the Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound is under contract with National Grid for a year-one price, adjustable with contingencies, of 18.7 cents per kwh. How do these prices compare with the price of solar locally? The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, which also has a rate-setting role in renewable energy, provided a list of 18 solar projects that have entered into contracts with National Grid since December 2011. The wholesale prices ranged from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents, with the largest projects having the lowest prices. Deepwater provided a similar list compiled from National Grid data, showing 21 Rhode Island solar projects, with prices also ranging from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents. By law in Rhode Island, solar projects enter into contracts with National Grid at a fixed price for 15 years and offshore wind at a price with annual escalators for 20 years. Four of the 21 solar projects on Deepwater’s list have initial prices lower than Deepwater’s Phase I price. All of them would be substantially less expensive than the final Phase I price because of the annual escalator. But let’s look at the Deepwater Phase II project that Grybowski was talking about, and let’s assume that his 13-to-14 cent estimate holds true. That’s cheaper initially than all of the Rhode Island solar projects. Phase II also has an escalating price -- Grybowski said the company expects to obtain a contract of about 20 years with prices escalating about 3 percent a year. The initial Deepwater price would be cheaper than all the solar prices. At year 12, the Deepwater price would surpass the cheapest solar project’s price. After 20 years, the Deepwater price would be about 23 cents -- still cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. It should be noted that comparisons of solar and offshore wind prices in Rhode Island are tricky because of scale. There’s not much room in our crowded, tiny state for the sort of large-scale solar projects that exist in the Southwest, for example. The largest solar project on Deepwater’s list, planned for the former Forbes Street Landfill, in East Providence, would have a capacity of 3.7 megawatts. Fifteen of the 21 are less than 1 megawatt, compared with the 1,000 megawatts of Deepwater’s Phase II. On the national level, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the most widespread kind of solar power, photovoltaic, has a ""levelized cost"" of 22.4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with offshore wind at 29.5 cents. ""Levelized cost is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies,"" the administration explains on its website. For a large-scale offshore wind project, Grybowski contends that the 29.5-cent estimate is inaccurate, based on faulty methodology. Our ruling Deepwater Wind’s Jeffrey Grybowski said offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy."" Deepwater’s small Phase I demonstration project would, in fact, be more expensive over time than all of the Rhode Island solar projects the company cited. But if Grybowski’s estimated electricity price for the much larger Phase II holds true, its price would ultimately be cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. The gap would be a few cents for the larger solar projects and up to 10 cents for the smallest.

Jerry Patterson,"“We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.”","Jerry Patterson, who won election to three terms as state land commissioner starting in 2002, filed to seek the post afresh in the 2018 elections. The former state senator from Pasadena unsuccessfully sought the 2014 Republican nomination for lieutenant governor.
","Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner seeking a third term this November, refers to the the state’s oil-soaked history in a recent column extolling renewable energy. In his article, published Tuesday in the Austin American-Statesman, Patterson writes: “We’re making more than ever off oil and gas right now, but it’s no secret that oil production in Texas peaked in the 1970s.” Even though oil production has been declining, state revenue from oil and gas is the tops? When we sought background, the General Land Office shared a chart showing state oil and gas income reached a historical high of $495 million in 1982 that wasn't exceeded until 2008, when it hit $533 million. The state's oil-and-gas-related proceeds dropped to $381 million in 2009, the land office says. Counting revenue during the first seven months of this fiscal year, we calculate it will reach $279 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year Aug. 31. Total state take during Patterson's seven-plus years as commissioner: $2.7 billion. And when did oil production peak? According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which tracks in-state oil production, the peak year for crude oil production was 1972 when more than 167,000 wells produced nearly 1.3 billion barrels. As of 2007, production had ebbed to about 336 million barrels. In 2008, production increased for the first time since 1991 to more than 346 million barrels, before falling in 2009, according to the commission. R.J. DeSilva, spokesperson for the State Comptroller's office, offered this analysis for the surge in state income from oil and gas surged well after oil production peaked: ""Oil and natural gas production are taxed on the value of oil and natural gas that’s produced. Oil and natural gas prices were higher in the early ‘80s than in the ‘70s (and reached all time highs in 2008)."" So how does Patterson’s statement shake out? He gets the peak-production timing right; it was the '70s. But he's off in saying state government is making more than ever from oil and gas ""right now."" That was true for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2008, but in 2009 state oil and gas revenue fell 29 percent from the year before and it's on pace to register another decline this fiscal year.

Obama's father is from Kenya and his mother is from Kansas. He graduated from Columbia University and received his law degree from Harvard Law School. Obama previously served in the Illinois state Senate and was an instructor at the University of Chicago Law School. He and his wife, Michelle, have two daughters, Malia and Sasha.","
Sen. Barack Obama injected a startling claim into the debate on energy, asserting in a Missouri town hall meeting that the country could save more gas from inflating its tires and tuning up its cars than would be gained from drilling more off its coasts.
 
""There are things that you can do individually, though, to save energy,"" Obama said in the July 30, 2008, appearance. ""Making sure your tires are properly inflated — simple thing. But we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires, and getting regular tune-ups. You could actually save just as much.""
 
Sen. John McCain and his allies — who advocate lifting the federal moratorium that bans drilling in some areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the U.S. coasts — immediately mocked Obama for the claim. The McCain campaign even offered to send ""Obama Energy Plan"" tire gauges to anyone who sent in a donation of $25 or more.
 
The McCain campaign's assumption seemed to be that Obama's claim was utterly implausible. And, we admit, it kind of sounds that way. But is it?
 
Under-inflated tires — to say nothing of poorly tuned cars — are actually a serious problem, as government agencies, industry groups, conservationists and outside experts have been saying for years. (The Obama campaign even cited a number of instances when prominent McCain supporters echoed the call for more public awareness about tire inflation.)
 
""A lot of people are driving around on severely under-inflated tires,"" said Robert Sinclair, Jr., a spokesman for the American Automobile Association. ""Try riding a bicycle with under-inflated tires. It's hard for the human engine to push it ahead. Pump it up, it seems like you're gliding on air.""
 
The same thing happens with a car. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by .4 percent for every 1 pounds-per-square-inch drop in tire pressure, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
 
The best estimate available, by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is that at least a quarter of drivers are cruising around on under-inflated tires. In April, the Rubber Manufacturers Association, the Auto Club, the California Highway Patrol and Yokohama Tire Company used those statistics, along with Department of Transportation and Automobile Association of America data, to extrapolate that 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost every year due to under-inflation of tires.
 
That's an estimate, to be sure, and not one from a published, peer-reviewed study. But remember, Obama said we ""could"" save all the oil available from offshore drilling in the protected areas — not we ""would"" — so if the claim is merely plausible he's on solid ground.
 
So how much oil is available offshore? According to the latest assessment from the Minerals Management Service, the mean estimate of undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil in the Outer Continental Shelf areas that are currently under moratorium is about 18-billion barrels (see

here

.)
 
But it couldn't all be extracted immediately. The agency estimates that if the moratorium were lifted production could start by 2017, and by 2030, oil companies could be producing 2.4-million barrels of oil instead of 2.2-million. That's 200,000 more barrels per day.
 
After refining, a barrel of oil can produce up to 19.5 gallons of gasoline, according to the

U.S. Department of Energy.

So that's 3.9-million more gallons of gasoline per day, or 1.4-billion gallons of gasoline per year.
 
And remember, an estimated 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost annually due to under-inflated tires.
 
And we didn't even talk about tune-ups. (Repairing a car that is noticeably out of tune or has failed an emissions test improves gas mileage by 4 percent on average, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Fixing a more serious problem, such as a bad oxygen sensor, can improve mileage by up to 40 percent, the agency says.)
 
All of the numbers in this analysis are estimates, we should emphasize. Oil industry experts told us estimates of the amount of oil offshore and how fast it could be extracted vary widely, and the Energy Information Administration's number is fairly optimistic. Likewise, it's highly unlikely any public awareness effort could change behavior enough to save 2.8-billion gallons of gasoline per day.
 
Second, it would take years of work to start producing 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline from oil pumped offshore -- the Energy Information Administration estimate contemplates production beginning in 2017. And the oil reserves would not be bottomless. Conceivably, the savings from tire-pressure correction could begin immediately and last indefinitely, thus easily overcoming the marginal difference in the estimates provided by the McCain campaign.
 
And finally, none of this takes into account the impact of tune-ups, which Obama mentioned as part of his claim. If Department of Energy estimates of 4 percent mileage improvement for better-tuned cars are true, that alone would push the total savings above the estimated drilling yield.
 
Goldfarb also pointed out that barrels of oil, in addition to yielding 19.5 gallons of gasoline, yield other products as well, such as jet fuel, lubricants and feed stocks. Point taken, but Obama's statement was made within the context of the current drilling debate, which has been about increasing the supply of domestic oil to ease the strain on the U.S. transportation sector.

Brad Rockwell,"Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer.""","Austin lawyer Brad Rockwell, who focuses on environmental matters, is former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance.
 
","Vivid image: Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler going to court to keep a judge from stopping petrochemicals from being dumped beneath Barton Springs. Austin attorney Brad Rockwell recently charged Adler, an eminent-domain lawyer, with doing just that. (Disclosure: Rockwell's daughter, Lilly Rockwell, covers city government for our parent newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. She wasn't involved in this fact check.) ""I met Steve Adler in litigation while he was representing a company who was dismantling the SOS ordinance,"" Rockwell said at a Nov. 12, 2014, press conference held with mayoral candidate Mike Martinez next to the lengthy spring-fed swimming pool. Adler and Martinez vie in a Dec. 16 runoff. At the press conference, Brad Rockwell was referring to the Save Our Springs law approved in 1992 to limit development potentially polluting the pool. Rockwell, former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, continued: ""Adler opposed our efforts to get an injunction to stop this company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" Did Adler battle for a company to dump oil ‘neath the pool? Adler represented Lowe’s It’s public record that Adler represented Lowe’s before an Austin state district judge in 2004 and opposed a temporary injunction, shortly granted, that kept Lowe’s from continuing to build a store in Southwest Travis County. In March 2005, though, the Austin City Council moved to settle the dispute, clearing the way for the Brodie Lane store. Adler and others went before a judge in July 2004 in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups that year intended to stop the Lowe’s project from being built on land in the heart of the Barton Springs recharge zone, described in Statesman news stories at the time as covering a 20-mile stretch of Travis and Hays counties. Rainfall in the zone percolates through soil and creek beds, a November 2003 Statesman news story said, replenishing the segment of the Edwards Aquifer that supplies not only Barton Springs but wells serving 50,000 residents. In question: Whether the plaintiffs were right that the construction was subject to the Save Our Springs ordinance limiting impervious cover to 15 percent or, as Lowe’s maintained, the company was free to put in up to 40 percent impervious cover in keeping with what Travis County permitted. In the July 1, 2004, hearing before Judge Scott Jenkins, Adler advanced reasons the project wasn’t subject to the SOS ordinance. Among his contentions: The land wasn’t in Austin’s purview, or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or if it was, the project still could proceed under looser development rules in place when plans were initially submitted to Sunset Valley. Engineer’s testimony And according to a hearing transcript, Adler didn’t say a word about whether Lowe’s should be allowed to pour petrochemicals into the earth. But during the hearing, parties seeking the injunction, including the city of Sunset Valley and Save Our Springs, called to the stand Lauren Ross, an environmental engineer, who testified about her visits to the construction site the day before. Asked if she observed conditions that would drive up average annual pollutants on the site after completion, Ross testified: ""There are clearly pollutants present on the site and discharging from the site that would not have been present prior to the beginning of the construction process."" Specifically, Ross said, she saw ""clear evidence of hydrocarbon sheens on the water in the construction rock"" around a fuel tank in violation of state requirements. Also, Ross testified, there’s ""no containment to prevent fuel spills from moving across the site."" She said that when she visited in the morning, a mesh silt fence intended to keep sediment from flowing off the site was breached at a spot where it looked to her like the land was graded to make all runoff head that way; she said the fence was restored by the time she returned in the afternoon. Most disturbing, Ross said, she saw that water running off the site wasn’t going into a culvert along Brodie Lane. Instead, she said, the flow was going into a hole in the ground onto limestone rock beneath, meaning all the project’s runoff was ""being discharged directly onto limestone that is presumably a recharge feature"" for the aquifer, she said. Asked what the flowing water looked like, Ross said the water had been filtered through the silt fence, but still had sediment and ""any of those escaping hydrocarbon sheens that we know are on the site at a more distant location."" Ross, asked her opinion of the environmental effect of the construction and on surrounding water features of the Lowe’s project, said: ""There is significant risk. And I think what I saw yesterday indicates it is much more than just a risk of contamination of downstream waters and the Edwards Aquifer from the proposed construction. It is clear that despite the engineering standards for erosion-type construction irrigation controls, these systems fail."" She also said she couldn’t recall seeing before the level of hydrocarbon sheens on a construction site that she saw on the Lowe’s site. Earlier in the hearing, Adler told the judge that stopping the $19 million project, which he called ""well underway,"" was ""going to cause greater environmental damage and greater harm than allowing the project to continue."" His legal contentions extended to mention of a 2003 state law intended to make the site subject only to Travis County’s development rules. Judge mentions ‘hydrocarbon spills’ Jenkins’ temporary injunction, issued July 2, 2004, said that if the construction continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury due to degradation of waters in nearby Williamson Creek, Barton Springs, the Edwards Aquifer and Sunset Valley water wells. The court further finds, Jenkins wrote, ""an increased risk of water pollution, were construction allowed to continue in violation of the SOS Ordinance, because of the failure risks inherent in man-made pollution-control features."" Also, Jenkins directed Lowe’s to ""ensure storm water runoff from the property be diverted from flowing into aquifer recharge features at or adjoining the property, that Lowe’s remove fuel tanks from the property, that Lowe’s remove from the property water contaminated by hydrocarbons and perform reasonable remediation of any hydrocarbon spills at the property."" In an interview, Rockwell stressed the judge’s order as an indication his statement was accurate as well as comments by Ross to the Austin Bulldog for a May 21, 2014, news story quoting her saying that what she saw the day before the hearing was ""totally my worst nightmare about why we need to minimize construction over the aquifer. The fuel storage tank failed, secondary containment around the tank failed. ... The silt fence was down, and there was direct migration into the Edwards Aquifer,"" Ross said. Adler calls claim 'outrageous' Adler called the dumping characterization outrageous. ""To dump petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer would be illegal in addition to being immoral,"" Adler said in an interview. ""Neither I nor Lowe’s nor co-counsel ever argued that the company should be able to dump petrochemicals into the aquifer."" The vital issue in court, Adler said, was whether a 4-3 vote by the Austin City Council in December 2003 was sufficient to let the development proceed. Save Our Springs and others successfully maintained in courts through 2004 that in keeping with the SOS ordinance, six council votes should have been required for the project to launch. Adler told us: ""Lowe’s doesn’t want to be dumping hydrocarbons down. No one in the courtroom would countenance dumping hydrocarbons down the aquifer."" Adler noted, too, that concerns about hydrocarbons going into the ground from the site weren’t part of pre-hearing briefs. Rockwell agreed, albeit pointing out no one knew of the oily sheen until the inspection visit by Ross. Rockwell, asked if his statement was an exaggeration, replied not. He also said that what he said at the press conference didn’t ""purport to summarize the whole litigation or everything about what the injunction fight was about. It’s one aspect, one very important aspect."" Other lawyers in the dispute To our inquiries, other lawyers in the dispute offered conflicting takes on this claim. Doug Young, the city attorney for Sunset Valley, which sided with the environmental groups in court, said by phone: ""Was Steve trying to vindicate the right of his client, Lowe’s, to dump petrochemicals down a recharge hole into the aquifer? No, I don’t think he was. But did he hear the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Ross that there were petrochemicals in the surface water there?"" Young added: ""It would be unreasonable to assume Lowe’s intended to dump that gas on the ground and either not worry about where it went or intend for it to go down this recharge feature. There’s no reason to believe that. But it happened. And they opposed"" the injunction to stop the construction. Daniel Byrne, who like Adler represented Lowe’s in the hearing, said by phone: ""The notion that anyone was pumping petrochemicals into the aquifer is complete garbage."" We emailed North Carolina-based Lowe’s about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" It’s not that simple. Adler, representing Lowe’s in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowe’s from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judge’s order in response said Lowe’s should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasn’t rooted in letting Lowe’s dump -- or stopping Lowe’s from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance.

Jeffrey Grybowski,"Offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy.""","Jeffrey R. Grybowski has been involved with the Deepwater Wind project since 2008, first as an outside lawyer then, as of 2012, chief executive officer. Grybowski formerly was policy director and chief of staff for Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri.
","July 31 was a red letter day for Deepwater Wind, a Providence company that hopes to build the first offshore wind farm in the United States. That was the day Deepwater was announced as the winner of a federal auction to lease space for the farm in a 257-square-mile area of waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts. (The company plans an initial demonstration project of five turbines off Block Island. The larger project would have more than 100 turbines.) It was in that context that Jeffrey R. Grybowski, chief executive officer of Deepwater Wind, appeared Aug. 4, 2013 on the TV public affairs show ""10 News Conference."" Host Bill Rappleye asked Grybowski how much the electricity generated by the turbines would cost. ""Yes, 13- to 14-cent power [offshore wind energy per kilowatt hour] is probably what we’re talking about, significantly lower than the cost of what we’ve seen for offshore wind to date,"" Grybowski said. ""Also, by the way, significantly less expensive than solar energy."" We wondered whether offshore wind is, in fact, cheaper than solar. We started with the state Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Public Utilities Commission, which both have important roles in setting the prices for renewable energy. Deepwater has negotiated with energy distributor National Grid, which is required to buy power from renewable sources, a wholesale price of 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for the five-turbine demonstration project, steadily ranging up to 46.9 cents per kilowatt hour in the last year of a 20-year contract, according to division officials. The demonstration would have a generating capacity of 30 megawatts -- a measure of peak output over an hour. (A megawatt is 1,000 kilowatts. The average U.S. home uses about 940 kilowatt hours per month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.) If the demonstration wind farm, called Phase I, works out as planned, Deepwater Wind expects to move forward on plans to build a large-scale wind farm, called Phase II, in the leased federal waters. Phase II would generate up to 1,000 megawatts -- enough, the company says, to power 350,000 homes. In an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, Grybowski said his comments on ""10 News Conference"" were about Phase II. He predicted that in the coming years, Deepwater will be able to negotiate with National Grid a wholesale price of 13 cents to 14 cents per kilowatt hour, escalating annually over the life of a contract. To check Grybowski’s claim, we first had to determine the price of offshore wind energy. That’s a challenge because no such project has yet been built in the United States. As proof that his 13- to 14-cent-per-kilowatt-hour estimate is realistic, Grybowski pointed to a formal offer by Deepwater in 2012 to sell Phase II energy in New York state for as low as 10 cents per kwh. The closest point of comparison is in nearby Massachusetts, where the Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound is under contract with National Grid for a year-one price, adjustable with contingencies, of 18.7 cents per kwh. How do these prices compare with the price of solar locally? The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, which also has a rate-setting role in renewable energy, provided a list of 18 solar projects that have entered into contracts with National Grid since December 2011. The wholesale prices ranged from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents, with the largest projects having the lowest prices. Deepwater provided a similar list compiled from National Grid data, showing 21 Rhode Island solar projects, with prices also ranging from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents. By law in Rhode Island, solar projects enter into contracts with National Grid at a fixed price for 15 years and offshore wind at a price with annual escalators for 20 years. Four of the 21 solar projects on Deepwater’s list have initial prices lower than Deepwater’s Phase I price. All of them would be substantially less expensive than the final Phase I price because of the annual escalator. But let’s look at the Deepwater Phase II project that Grybowski was talking about, and let’s assume that his 13-to-14 cent estimate holds true. That’s cheaper initially than all of the Rhode Island solar projects. Phase II also has an escalating price -- Grybowski said the company expects to obtain a contract of about 20 years with prices escalating about 3 percent a year. The initial Deepwater price would be cheaper than all the solar prices. At year 12, the Deepwater price would surpass the cheapest solar project’s price. After 20 years, the Deepwater price would be about 23 cents -- still cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. It should be noted that comparisons of solar and offshore wind prices in Rhode Island are tricky because of scale. There’s not much room in our crowded, tiny state for the sort of large-scale solar projects that exist in the Southwest, for example. The largest solar project on Deepwater’s list, planned for the former Forbes Street Landfill, in East Providence, would have a capacity of 3.7 megawatts. Fifteen of the 21 are less than 1 megawatt, compared with the 1,000 megawatts of Deepwater’s Phase II. On the national level, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the most widespread kind of solar power, photovoltaic, has a ""levelized cost"" of 22.4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with offshore wind at 29.5 cents. ""Levelized cost is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies,"" the administration explains on its website. For a large-scale offshore wind project, Grybowski contends that the 29.5-cent estimate is inaccurate, based on faulty methodology. Our ruling Deepwater Wind’s Jeffrey Grybowski said offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy."" Deepwater’s small Phase I demonstration project would, in fact, be more expensive over time than all of the Rhode Island solar projects the company cited. But if Grybowski’s estimated electricity price for the much larger Phase II holds true, its price would ultimately be cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. The gap would be a few cents for the larger solar projects and up to 10 cents for the smallest. Deepwater Wind’s Jeffrey Grybowski said offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy."" Deepwater’s small Phase I demonstration project would, in fact, be more expensive over time than all of the Rhode Island solar projects the company cited.

Mitch McConnell,Says Matt Bevin has repeatedly failed to pay his taxes.,Mitch McConnell is a U.S. Senator from Kentucky and the Republican minority leader in the U.S. Senate.,"The McConnell campaign ad paints a picture of Matt Bevin as a man with a track record of unpaid taxes. The claim is based on back taxes owed by a bell-making company in Connecticut that was owned by members of the Bevin family, and Bevin’s failure to pay taxes on a vacation house in Maine. With the bell maker, based on the paper trail and interviews, it’s reasonable to conclude that the company was in financial trouble before Bevin was deeply involved.

This makes it difficult to see where the McConnell claim holds up.   As for the house in Maine, Bevin showed a lapse in overseeing the property tax payments, but the change in mortgage companies at a time when the lender was headed toward bankruptcy is a significant factor.

Bill White,Says Gov. Rick Perry is “by far and away the highest-paid state employee on an hourly basis.”,"Bill White, an author, is a San Antonio native who was mayor of Houston from 2004-2009. He was the 2010 Democratic nominee for governor of Texas.
","
White’s campaign cited Perry’s public schedule for January through May and its calculation that Perry accumulated 145.5 hours of scheduled events in the period. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in an e-mail: “We followed (Perry’s) state schedule and counted 1 hour for events, 1/2 hour for phone calls, 1/2 hour for press conferences. Most busy CEOs get in and out and get things done. Church was not counted.” 
Bacon added that she’s heard Mack Brown, head coach of the University of Texas football team, is the highest-paid state employee, “but you can bet he works a lot more than seven hours a week.”
 
We’re not testing Brown’s work ethic, but we’re game for White’s charge, which his campaign based on dividing five months’ of Perry’s $150,000 annual salary—about $62,500—by 146 (rounding up from 145.5 hours of state-scheduled events as listed on his schedule), resulting in an “hourly” pay rate of about $428. 
Made sense for Bacon to mention the UT coach, who’s widely known for having the top salary among state workers, at $5.1 million. Presuming a 40-hour work week, Brown’s hourly rate breaks out to nearly $2,452. Presuming a 60-hour week--head football coaches work notoriously long hours--Brown’s hourly rate drops to nearly $1,635. If Brown improbably worked around the clock, his hourly rate would be $582, still more than the hourly rate White calculates for Perry. 
Another UT coach and the head football coaches at Texas A&M University and Texas Tech University each make $1.5 million or more, as noted in a 2010 chart compiled by the online Texas Tribune listing the highest-paid state workers. Assuming each works 60 hours a week, their salaries translate to hourly rates of $481 or more. 
Then again, the argument is often made that college coaches like Brown, whose salary derives from sports revenues, are in a special category. What about other state employees? 
Separately, we asked the state comptroller’s office to break out the state’s highest-paid workers, including Perry. The agency, citing salary figures as of April, generated a list taking into account about 157,000 state workers, excluding college and university employees, which it does not track. 
The compilation suggests Perry’s annual salary is less than what the state pays 313 other workers, topped by Britt Harris, chief investment officer of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, at $480,000. We called the system and inquired into how many hours Harris works. Spokesman Howard Goldman said “well over 40” hours a week. Assuming Harris works an average of 60 hours weekly, his hourly rate runs about $154. If he’s averaging 50 hours a week, the rate would be about $185. 
Perry’s hourly wage is more than double those amounts, per White’s calculation of his working hours based on events posted on his official schedule. This begs the question: Is the schedule an accurate indicator of how much time Perry spends on the job? 
That’s a toughie because the schedule is far from complete, making it hard for anyone to gauge how the governor spends his time. In 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reviewed the calendars for the state’s top six statewide elected officials covering January through March of that year. The newspaper said that while the officials’ calendars “did not prove to be comprehensive accountings of their working hours, they yielded glimpses of how the officials spent their time.” 
Perry had state-related events on fewer than 40 days during the period, the newspaper reported, counting a parade, a coach's salute and two Washington dinners--and he had no state-scheduled events on 31 weekdays.  
A Perry spokesman at the time, Robert Black, was quoted noting that Perry had just assumed the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association and started promoting his book saluting the Boy Scouts. “Both these events took up a considerable amount of the governor's time,” Black said, “but working hard to elect more conservative governors across the nation and espousing the values and virtues of the Boy Scouts of America is well worth the effort.”  
Of late, Bacon told us in an e-mail, it’s up to Perry to prove he’s been busy with state business in the many hours he did not have scheduled events. She said: “When you're a CEO, you can't have last-minute meetings. Things have to be planned in advance.” 
We didn’t hear back from Perry’s campaign or his state office. But we came across this reaction to the White campaign calculation from Perry, as reported by Hearst Newspapers columnist Peggy Fikac: “If they've made anybody that can outwork me yet, please introduce me to him or her. Texans know I am mobile, I am agile, and I'm going to continue doing work for 'em 24/7. Just because it doesn't show up on my schedule doesn't mean I'm not out working for the people of the state of Texas, thank you very much."" 
Bacon spotted the same Perry reaction, which she termed “truly priceless” in an e-mail. “He is ‘mobile’ and ‘agile?’ What does that have to do with working seven hours a week while drawing a full-time salary? Sounds more like something related to jogging ... and shooting coyotes,” wrote Bacon -- a reference to Perry’s declaration this year that he shot a coyote while jogging. 
Seeking historical perspective, we called chiefs of staff to the governors preceding Perry, George W. Bush and Ann Richards. 
Joe M. Allbaugh, who was Gov. Bush’s chief of staff,  said Bush’s official schedule didn’t reflect his work days, which often ran from early in the morning into evenings, especially if lawmakers were in session. “This is foolish and hogwash for the White campaign to draw this type of comparison,” Allbaugh said. “All public officials put in more hours than they’re paid. It doesn’t matter if you’re Democratic, Republican or Martian, your public service is not for the money.” 
We asked Allbaugh, who backs Perry’s re-election, if it’s possible Perry enjoys a lot of down time. Allbaugh replied: “I don’t know if it’s possible to do that or not. People need to remember, that person is governor full time... Hurricanes, oil spills, they don’t call up (from) 8 to 5 (saying:) ‘By the way, is the governor in?’” 
Next, we reached Austin lobbyist John Fainter, who was a chief of staff for Richards when she was governor and earlier served as secretary of state with Gov. Mark White. Fainter, who has contributed to Perry's campaign kitty, said governors don’t ever get away from work. “Things come up,” Fainter said. “The schedule is largely irrelevant as to the time they actually spend on duties.” 
We get it: Texas governors don’t punch time clocks.  
Where does that leave White’s statement that Perry is “far and away” the highest-paid state worker on an hourly basis? 
For starters, Perry’s hourly wage as calculated by White is less than what we calculated for several state employees (coaches).  
Most importantly, he assumes the public schedule released by Perry’s office accounts for all his working hours. But according to the Statesman’s previous reporting as well as two veterans of the governor’s office, such schedules are woefully incomplete. 
White could have sought a better accounting of how the governor spends his time without cobbling together comparisons that don’t hold up. ",W. Gardner Selby,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2010/jul/12/bill-white/white-citing-available-schedule-says-perry-far-and/,pants-fire

Arizona law requires county officials to verify signatures on mail ballots and Maricopa County had at least 100 workers involved in signature verification. Lake’s lawsuit alleges that Maricopa’s signature verification process is flawed. The lawsuit cites a report by the state attorney general who concluded that Maricopa’s signature verification in 2020 was inefficient to guard against abuse. But a judge found the county followed the process for verifying signatures.  Many of the allegations in Lake’s lawsuit about 2022 stem from signed affidavits from three signature verification workers who concluded the verification process was flawed. These are anecdotal reports about their impressions of the process and are not proof of wrongdoing. A judge has yet to rule on the allegations in Lake’s lawsuit, but we found no evidence that Arizona used no signature verification.

Experts analyze and verify those reports to identify trends in after-effects and patient risk factors, as well as monitor vaccines that have been available for decades. The database includes a disclaimer that says the number of reports about a specific vaccine should not be used to draw conclusions about vaccine safety. Experts say that as the anti-vaccination movement has grown in recent years, the database has seen increasing numbers of misleading reports. More publicity of the database has also contributed to more people reporting adverse events. Experts say COVID-19 vaccinations are tested rigorously and monitored as they are released to the public. Furthermore, scientific studies of thousands of children have determined that serious adverse events after vaccination are rare and that vaccinations are effective against COVID-19.
