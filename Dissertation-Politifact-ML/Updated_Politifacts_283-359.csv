State Sen. Harold Metts said, ""Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent."" 
For better or worse, recidivism rates are usually calculated based on how many former inmates are found guilty of a subsequent crime and end up back in prison within three years. 
The most recent data from the Department of Corrections cover two years and the rate is 42 percent. The most recent study to look at a three-year period, which covered inmates released in 2004, put the rate at 54 percent. 
The only way to get above 60 percent is to use the older study and look at an entirely different category: the number of ex-convicts who were brought back to the ACI because they had been charged with a new crime or with violating their probation. But that percentage is flawed as well because it includes at least some people who would never have seen a jail cell if they had been able to afford bail. 
Metts offered his ""over 60 percent"" as a definitive statistic. It's not. Although most of the measures we saw offered a lower number, those studies only followed the former inmates for three years or less, an artificial cutoff that makes it easier to collect statistics yet doesn't reflect the fact that anyone who goes back to prison after three years is still regarded as a recidivist.

Obama's father is from Kenya and his mother is from Kansas. He graduated from Columbia University and received his law degree from Harvard Law School. Obama previously served in the Illinois state Senate and was an instructor at the University of Chicago Law School. He and his wife, Michelle, have two daughters, Malia and Sasha.","
Biden cited a March 2007 policy brief from the independent Brookings Institution which concluded ""COPS appears to have contributed to the drop in crime observed in the 1990s.""
 
""Given that the costs of crime to American society are so large – perhaps as much as $2-trillion per year – even small percentage reductions in crime can reap very large benefits,"" the Brookings report found. ""COPS appears to be one of the most cost-effective options available for fighting crime.""
 
And a 2002 study by researchers at the University of Nebraska and Southwest Texas State University found COPS had a major effect on cutting crime from 1994 through 2000, particularly in big cities.
""These studies confirm the common sense intuition that if you have an intersection with four street corners, and you have cops on three of the four corners, a crime is more likely to be committed on the fourth,"" Biden said in his letter.
 
Lastly, Biden said, ""the COPS program was not the only innovation of the 1994 Crime Bill that contributed to falling crime rates. The principle innovation of the 1994 Crime Bill was its recognition that to effectively fight crime you need an approach that coordinates prevention, enforcement and rehabilitation. The Crime Bill's three-part strategy helped reduce crime in the 1990s in New York City and in cities nationwide. And it's the strategy we need to continue fighting crime in our country.""
 
We stand by our ruling, on the grounds that the 100,000 new officers claim is at best suspect, and because we believe that Biden assigned more credit for reducing the murder and violent crime rates than the program deserves. Independent reports – even ones that praise the program for reducing crime – only credit COPS for being a portion of the reason for the decline in violent crime (and only a modest portion, according to the GAO).

Joe Biden,"""In the 1990s, the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets. As a result, murder and violent crime rates went down eight years in a row.""","Joe Biden is the president of the United States. A Democrat, Biden served as a Delaware senator from 1973 (elected at the age of 29) until 2009. During his time in the Senate, he served as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, chair of the International Narcotics Control Caucus and chair of the Judiciary Committee. He subsequently served as Barack Obama’s vice president from 2009 to 2016. Biden launched unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008. He received a degree in history and political science from the University of Delaware and his J.D. from Syracuse School of Law. ","
While it may seem intuitive that putting more cops on the beat would deter crime, several government and independent studies have failed to prove a strong link between COPS and the 32 percent drop in violent crime rates from 1993 to 2001.
 
An October 2005 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that COPS helped cut crime modestly, about 1.1 percent in 1997 and as much as 1.3 percent in 2000, at a cost of some $8-billion.
 
""While we find that COPS expenditures led to increases in sworn police officers above levels that would have been expected without these expenditures, and though the increases in sworn officers led to declines in crime, we conclude that COPS grants were not the major cause of the decline in crime from 1994 through 2001,"" the GAO report said. ""Other factors ... combined to contribute more to
the reduction in crime than did COPS expenditures.
 
""This is not surprising, as COPS expenditures ... made a comparatively small contribution to local law
enforcement expenditures for policing.""
 
More recently, a peer-reviewed study published in the February 2007 issue of the journal

Criminology

found that ""COPS spending had little to no effect on crime.""
 
The exception was a 2002 study by researchers at the University of Nebraska and Southwest Texas State University, which found COPS had a major effect on cutting crime from 1994 through 2000, particularly in big cities. But the study was funded by the COPS program, raising questions of impartiality, and it failed to account for changing demographics after 1994. It also ignored the fact that crime was already dropping nationwide before COPS existed, critics said.
 
In reality, studies show that no one thing — not even Biden's army of officers — can take credit for the declining crime rate in the 1990s and first five years of this century. Rather, it was likely the result of a complex series of factors, including population shifts, an improving economy, longer prison sentences for violent criminals, better policing and changes in drug use.

Mehmet Oz,“John Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities.”,Physician and talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is a 2022 candidate for the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat from Pennsylvania.,"Oz said Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities."" Fetterman has not called for releasing one-third of ""dangerous criminals."" In 2020, he said he agreed with what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s corrections secretary that the state’s prison population could be reduced by one-third — without a risk to public safety. Attacking his election opponent as ""crazier than you think,"" Mehmet Oz tweeted an ad to his 3.8 million Twitter followers that made this claim: ""John Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities."" Oz, a physician and former TV talk show host, is the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Fetterman, a Democrat, is the state’s lieutenant governor. The race, rated by campaign watchers as ""tilts Republican"" and a toss-up, could help decide which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Fetterman has touted work to increase the number of pardons issued to prison inmates in Pennsylvania and has called for reducing the prison population in other ways, but we did not find an instance of Fetterman calling for the release of one-third of dangerous criminals. In 2020, Fetterman twice highlighted what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s then-corrections secretary that the state could reduce its prison population by one-third without risking public safety.  Oz tweeted his ad on July 18, the same day his team announced the ad was part of a ""Liberal-O-Meter"" campaign to highlight Fetterman’s ""radical policies and crazy statements.""  It’s not the first time he has made the claim. Oz said in a June 13 speech that Fetterman said, ""We should release one-third of all inmates, including violent offenders."" And in a video ad published on YouTube July 14, Oz said Fetterman ""supports releasing one-third of the prison population."" To back up the claim, Oz’s campaign referred PolitiFact to a June 22 article in the conservative-leaning Daily Caller and to two Fetterman tweets cited in the article. The article said Fetterman twice in 2020 ""appeared to endorse"" releasing one-third of the state’s prison population.  In May 2020, Fetterman tweeted: ""PA’s Correction Secretary has said: ‘We could reduce our prison population by 1/3 and not make anyone less safe.’"" And in July 2020, he tweeted: ""Our Corrections Secretary has said we could"" release ""1/3 of our inmates and not make anyone less safe. What if we directed those savings into our state schools?""  The corrections secretary was John Wetzel, who was appointed to the post in 2011 by Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. In announcing in September 2021 that Wetzel would leave the post, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, praised Wetzel for reducing the state’s prison population. PolitiFact searched Google, the Nexis news archive, and Wetzel’s Twitter account, and did not find an instance in which Wetzel made such a statement, so we asked Fetterman’s campaign about the Wetzel remarks. Spokesperson Joe Calvello responded that the campaign could not find the exact quote, but that Wetzel has made similar comments, such as in 2021, when Wetzel advocated for medical parole for elderly inmates, saying most who would be eligible ""are incapacitated and not a security threat."" Calvello said that Fetterman was not expressing an opinion on releasing one-third of its inmates but was citing Wetzel’s comments to highlight the cost of Pennsylvania’s prison system.  We tried to reach Wetzel via LinkedIn and his consultant agency on Facebook, but got no reply. On Aug. 17, Fox News posted a story that linked to a video from an Oct. 7, 2020, panel discussion on reducing incarceration. In that video, Celeste Trusty of the Families Against Mandatory Minimums advocacy group asked Fetterman about reducing the number of prison inmates in Pennsylvania age 50 and over.  Fetterman said, ""We’re actively trying to audit our population to identify those inmates that are most deserving and does it make sense."" He said he agreed with a statement he attributed to Wetzel that ""we could reduce our prison population by a third and not make anyone less safe in Pennsylvania."" Fetterman has called for ""second chances"" for offenders, such as eliminating mandatory life-without-parole sentences for certain murder convictions and for other criminal justice reforms. Fetterman’s campaign website includes one video promoting his record as lieutenant governor in increasing pardons for prison inmates in Pennsylvania; in the other video, Fetterman calls for overhauling the criminal justice system, saying, ""There are individuals that, quite frankly, don’t need to be in prison, it doesn’t make anyone more safe."" Pennsylvania ranked 25th among states in the number of people incarcerated in state prisons per 100,000 residents, based on 2019 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics data, according to The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that works to minimize imprisonment. Oz said Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities."" Fetterman has not called for releasing one-third of ""dangerous criminals."" In 2020, he said he agreed with what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s corrections secretary that the state’s prison population could be reduced by one-third — without a risk to public safety.

Blake did have an active warrant for sexual assault and several other crimes related to domestic violence at the time he was shot. But Blake was not convicted of any prior gun offenses. Charges filed in 2015 were ultimately dismissed at the request of prosecutors. When Kenosha police shot a Black man in the back seven times, it launched a now all-too-familiar avalanche of reaction. Protests. Property damage. And an online rush to judgement fueled by each poster’s pre-existing position on social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. Police shot Jacob Blake, 29, on the evening of Aug. 23, 2020, as he attempted to get into a small SUV with his three sons inside while officers aimed guns at him, according to officials and a bystander’s video of the incident that has been shared throughout the world. Blake survived, but his family’s attorney said he is paralyzed from the waist down At this stage, there are more questions than answers about what happened before the video was taken.

Such allegations are a common and patently unfair response to tragic events that need to be corrected, said Daniel Medwed, professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University School of Law.  Attacks on a victim’s actions and background can impact both the court of public opinion and the ensuing criminal court actions, he said. ""You’re fighting in two different courts basically with a high-profile case, and victim-blaming can 'help' with both,"" Medwed said. ""The narrative seems to always be about the danger posed by the victim, to basically create a sentiment that police were in danger. … The implication from that is that because there’s something bad about their character they somehow deserved what they got, which is patently absurd and absolutely disgusting."" Here’s what we know about Blake’s past contact with law enforcement. The first part of this claim is largely accurate. Blake was charged July 6, 2020, with felony third-degree sexual assault and misdemeanor trespassing and disorderly conduct. All three offenses carried a penalty enhancer because they were connected to domestic abuse. The charges — which have not gone to trial — stem from a May 3, 2020, incident in Kenosha County. A woman Blake knew told police he came into her house about 6 a.m., sexually assaulted her and then took a debit card and car keys before fleeing in her vehicle, according to a criminal complaint. (Contrary to many social media claims, the woman involved in this case was an adult). A warrant for Blake’s arrest was filed the day after the criminal complaint, online court records show. Police radio traffic shows officers were dispatched for ""family trouble,"" and a dispatcher named Blake as taking the caller’s keys and refusing to give them back. A dispatcher used the police code 10-99 while sending officers, alerting them to Blake's warrant. The second element of the claim is wrong. Blake was charged with a gun-related offense in 2015, but he was not convicted. The Facebook post offered as proof a Sept. 22, 2015, article from the Racine County Eye website. It described charges being filed, but did not reference a conviction. Our review of court records shows a confrontation at a Racine County bar led to a combative traffic stop and a total of five criminal charges in September 2015, including resisting an officer, disorderly conduct and three gun-related ones. But those charges were later dismissed on a motion from prosecutors, said Racine County Clerk of Circuit Court Samuel Christensen. The court file said it was dismissed in February 2018 ""due to witness issues and age of case."" After this fact-check published, the Facebook page that posted the claim edited the post to note the error and correct the reference to a conviction. Since more than two years has passed since the case was dismissed, it is no longer visible via online court records, per a Wisconsin Supreme Court rule.  A viral Facebook post says Blake had a warrant for sexual assault and prior convictions for gun use. Blake did have an active warrant for sexual assault and several other crimes related to domestic violence at the time he was shot. But Blake was not convicted of any prior gun offenses. Charges filed in 2015 were ultimately dismissed at the request of prosecutors.

Michael Bloomberg,"""No other city in America did what (New York) did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%.""","Michael Bloomberg was mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. The billionaire co-founded Bloomberg LP, a financial information and media company, in 1981. On Nov. 24, 2019, he announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president and dropped out on March 4, 2020.","Bloomberg said, ""No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%."" He’s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers. But Bloomberg can’t claim all the credit, in that the declines began before he took office and continued afterward; and experts including the FBI warn against using statistics to make city-to-city comparisons. Now let’s dig into each of the four parts of his current claim. Bloomberg’s campaign cited data showing there were 649 murders in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, and 335 in 2013, his final year in office. That’s a reduction of roughly half. But murders started declining a decade before Bloomberg took office and continued downward after he left.  Murders dropped ""precipitously"" during the 1990s — from roughly 2,200 at the start of the decade, noted Ames Grawert of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. ""Was the slope any steeper during Bloomberg than in the preceding decade? Not at all,"" said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of law and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. In 2013, the total number of shots fired by officers — 248 — and total shooting incidents — 81 — were the lowest since the New York Police Department began keeping such records in 1971, according to the department’s 2013 annual firearms discharge report, which Bloomberg’s campaign cited. Police shot and killed eight people and injured 17 others that year, the report says. But here, too, Bloomberg appears to be going too far by taking credit: The trend downward started before Bloomberg took office. And while shooting incidents hit the record low of 81 in 2013, they had risen to 105 a year earlier, during his tenure. ""The fact that reductions have continued under de Blasio shows that the declines are being driven by factors other than the municipal genius of mayoral-led policing and prosecutorial strategies,"" said Eugene O’Donnell, a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.  In 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, New York City had 703 jailed or imprisoned inmates for every 100,000 residents, according to the mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice. In 2013, it was 429  — a drop of 39%. The same chart shows, however, that the decline began years before Bloomberg took office and has continued for years afterward, the figure was 910 in 1996 before dropping to the 703 in 2001, a decline of 23% in five years. And there’s another issue. ""The criminal prosecution/punishment decisions are not those of the mayor or his administration,"" said Franklin Zimring, a University of California, Berkeley, School of Law faculty director of criminal justice studies and author of the 2012 book, ""The City That Became Safe: New York’s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control."" Bloomberg’s campaign says no other city has achieved the three reductions Bloomberg touted. There is truth to that. ""New York City is in a class by itself in the country on public safety — serious crime has dropped for decades,"" O’Donnell told us. But comparisons are dicey. The FBI is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Among other things, the FBI points out that no two cities are alike and the rates at which crimes are reported vary among cities. Bloomberg said, ""No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%."" He’s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers.

Scott Walker,"Says Tony Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities.""","Scott Walker, a Republican, is the former governor of Wisconsin. He was first elected in November 2010. He survived a recall election in 2012, defeating Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett after igniting controversy with a bill curtailing public-employee union collective-bargaining rights.  He won re-election to a four-year term in November 2014 and was a 2016 presidential candidate before dropping out in September of 2015. He was defeated by Tony Evers in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Walker is a former Milwaukee County executive and former member of the state Assembly.","Walker says Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released. A new, similar Walker attack  — zeroing in on Tony Evers  — has a similar problem. On Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad. The governor’s spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he ""failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools."" Then the narrator asserts that Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Walker’s use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check. That is, a 50 percent reduction ""today"" — rather than say, over a period of years — would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. There are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includes those who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation or extended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury. But Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction. And it’s important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isn’t the only way to cut the prison population in half. On the day Walker’s TV ad was released, Evers reacted by telling reporters: ""That’s a lie. I never said that. We will not release violent criminals. We’re not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker."" (Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.) To back the first part of Walker’s claim — that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walker’s campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate  between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope. Moderator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population  — Evers: Absolutely, and that's a goal that’s worth accomplishing … We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. The Walker campaign argues that Evers’ response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAH’s website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015. But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years. And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame. Evers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison. He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior. 
Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us it’s possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes — or at least not thousands of them. Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations.   Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround. But, despite Walker’s claim, it’s also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. One more point before we close: Ryan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses. Walker says Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released.

Finally, we found a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report that cautions the relationship between female homicide victims and their killers is unknown in as many as one third of the cases. This makes the actual number of women killed by intimate partners difficult to determine. One could argue the tally is higher than the studies show.

Kamala Harris,"""It costs us about $33,000 a year (on average nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year.""","Kamala Harris is the vice president of the United States. Harris was elected as a senator from California in 2016. She previously was California’s attorney general from 2011 to 2017. From 2004 until 2011, she was the district attorney of San Francisco. Harris received a bachelor’s degree in political science and economics from Howard University and a J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of Law. In 2019, she ran for the Democratic nomination for president and dropped out in December. On Aug. 11, 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden named Harris as his running mate.","Our research A spokesperson for Harris provided us with data on the cost of federal incarceration, from the independent Vera Institute of Justice, as well as numbers for California, based on Gov. Jerry Brown’s spending plan for the 2017-18 fiscal year. In its May 2017 report ""The Price of Prisons,"" the Vera Institute examined the cost to house inmates at prisons nationwide. It obtained data for 45 states and found the total cost per inmate averaged $33,274. The institute advocates for reducing inmate totals and improving conditions in prisons. It reported receiving about three-quarters of its funding from the federal government. The study’s findings support Harris’ claim on the average cost of housing inmates nationally. But what about the California’s per inmate price of $75,000? For that figure, Harris’ spokesman cited a June 2017 article by the Associated Press. It estimated the cost per inmate would reach a record $75,560 in the current fiscal year. The AP based its estimate on the money Gov. Brown set aside in this year’s budget for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. To verify this figure and put it in context, we examined the governor’s 2017-18 budget and contacted the Brown Administration’s corrections and finance departments, as well as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. These sources pointed us to the projected $76,320 cost per inmate in Brown’s 2017-18 budget. That qualifies as ""about $75,000"" as Harris put it. A spokeswoman for the state’s corrections department told us California paid about $73,000 per inmate last fiscal year, also very close to Harris’ number. Cost in context While Harris’ numbers are nearly spot on, we wanted to know what’s driving this high cost to lock up prisoners in California. The expense to house each inmate has doubled since 2005, even as court orders reduced the prison population by about a quarter, according to the Associated Press. Several reasons account for the dramatic increase. Viewed simply, fewer inmates combined with higher corrections spending equals a higher per capita cost. But why are there fewer inmates and higher spending? California was forced to cut inmate levels after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that overcrowding in prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The drop in inmates hasn’t led to the closure of any prisons and hasn’t led to a reduction of prison staffing that corresponds directly to the drop in inmates. Jonathan Peterson, an analyst at the Legislative Analyst’s Office, said that’s because there are security requirements at the prisons that don’t allow for the elimination of guards simply because there are fewer inmates. ""Regardless of how many inmates are in a particular unit, you still need the one guard to open and close the doors,"" Peterson said. The governor’s budget expects a nearly 2-to-1 inmate to prison staff ratio for the current fiscal year. That’s down from a ratio of a 2.24-to-1 just two years ago. Higher employee costs Just as the inmate population started to drop, employee compensation in the prison system jumped significantly. The corrections department budget has gone up $1.2 billion since 2012 due to employee compensation and retirement costs, according to the Department of Finance. Of that increase, $436 million is directly tied to increased pension contributions by the state for prison employees. Additionally, in July 2013, the state opened the California Health Care Facility providing 2,600 beds for inmates needing medical attention. The facility has cost $288 million since it opened, the finance department reported. California voters have contributed to the shrinking prison population in recent years by approving ballot measures that reclassify many felony drug and property crimes as misdemeanors and improving chances for parole for offenders classified as nonviolent. These measures are expected to further reduce the prison population by thousands of inmates. If that happens and prison employee costs rise or stay stable, California’s per capita inmate expense will continue to be higher than other states. Our ruling Sen. Kamala Harris recently claimed ""it costs us about $33,000 a year (nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year."" A recent study that examined costs in 45 states plus data from California’s departments of corrections and finance support the senator’s statement. Digging deeper, we found reducing inmates in California’s prisons, which Harris supports, may actually increase the per capita costs she highlights. That will be especially true if salary and pension costs continue to increase as inmate numbers drop. Harris doesn’t make a specific claim about what’s driving these costs. Her statement centers on the costs alone to house inmates nationally and in California. The evidence supports the figures she cited. Sen.

Here’s a summary of the incident from our Clinton fact check, based on a report by the Milwaukee County district attorney: First call: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee at the Starbucks located in Red Arrow Park downtown called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a ""welfare check"" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about ""a homeless guy sleeping"" there. Two officers respond: Because Manney didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification and said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left. Second call: About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers returned and told the employees that Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., about 90 minutes after the first call, Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked ""that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject"" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him.

Fight occurs: Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times.

Manney shoots Hamilton: The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. He fired 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. In announcing Manney’s firing, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Manney decided Hamilton was dangerous ""based solely on observations of apparent mental illness, absent any overt actions on the part of Mr. Hamilton."" Our rating Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."" Two officers twice responded to calls about Hamilton sleeping in the park and allowed him to continue sleeping there and left. He was still resting there when a different officer later and arrived and began patting him down. That triggered a physical altercation, with the officer hitting Hamilton with his baton and then Hamilton taking the baton and striking the officer. The officer then fatally shot Hamilton 14 times. In short, Hamilton was not shot simply for resting on a park bench. But the shooting occurred only because of a physical altercation that was sparked by the way the third officer began patting Hamilton down -- after two officers who came to the park twice decided Hamilton wasn’t doing anything wrong. In fact, the officer was fired for the way he approached Hamilton. Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee.""

","Travis Allen is a Republican and a member of the California State Assembly, representing the Orange County area. He is a 2018 candidate for California governor.
","California state Assemblyman Travis Allen claimed in a recent column that ""Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California."" His claim profoundly distorts a new state law that treats minors engaged in commercial sex acts as victims, but does nothing to legalize prostitution. Young people under age 18 who solicit sex won’t be arrested and sent to juvenile hall. Instead, officers will have the option of taking them into temporary custody if they are in immediate danger or need medical attention. It also says officers shall report the circumstances of minors engaged in prostitution to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect. The law does nothing to change the fact that it is illegal to have sex with minors, solicit prostitutes or arrange clients. Allen’s specific claim, and the column in general, is grossly misleading.

Donald Trump,"""Inner-city crime is reaching record levels.""","Donald Trump is the former president of the United States.

Trump's statements were awarded PolitiFact's 2015, 2017 and 2019 Lie of the Year.

Later in June, the National Institute of Justice -- an office within the U.S. Justice Department -- released a paper that analyzed the uptick. It was written by Richard Rosenfeld, who studies crime at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Rosenfeld found that the preliminary increase in homicides ""was real and nearly unprecedented."" But he also added that it was not universal in the nation’s big cities. Only certain cities seemed to see significant increases. Specifically, he found that 10 out of the 56 large cities he studied ""produced two-thirds of the big-city homicide increase in 2015."" Most cities either showed small increases or declines. Here is a chart he assembled showing how big or small a spike each of the cities experienced:  Rosenfeld found that the 10 cities with the biggest spikes tended to have higher poverty rates, higher African-American populations and smaller Hispanic populations. However, he wrote that beyond that, there is insufficient public data available at this time to determine the precise cause, or mix of causes, for the top 10 cities’ homicide spikes. In any case, none of this supports Trump’s more recent statement that crime is approaching ""record levels."" Even if the recent spike proves durable, the rates of homicides and violent crime in general have fallen so much in the past 25 years that the recent increases will not push them up to ""record"" levels at any time in the near future. ""The increase in crime in inner cities in 2015 was a large one-year increase, but you can see that the long-term trend is way down,"" said Alan Lizotte, a criminologist at the University at Albany. ""The recent spike would need to continue for a while to reach early 1990s levels."" ""Inner-city crime rates are not even close to record levels,"" agreed James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. ""And crime rates among African-Americans, especially youth, were much, much higher in the early 1990s."" Our ruling Trump said that ""inner-city crime is reaching record levels."" Criminologists say that it is worth watching the recent jump in homicides in certain big cities to see whether it represents a lasting trend or just a blip. However, the homicide rate and the violent crime rate has fallen to such an extent over the past quarter century -- both in big cities and in the country at large -- that it would take many years of significant increases to return to the ""record levels"" of the early 1990s.

U.Va. estimates of the full cost for attending in the 2013-14 school year ranged from $26,000 to $31,000 for in-state students.

When all those costs are put together, they exceed the annual prisoner costs Sanders cites. Still, the truth behind Sanders’ statement rests to some extent on the length of sentence for each prisoner and where they are held. If their incarceration surpasses four years, then it easily could surpass the cost of sending a student to the University of Virginia. Also, if that prisoner is held in a state such as New York, with high state prisoner incarceration costs of roughly $60,000 annually, it also could outpace the cost of sending someone to U.Va.

","
State Sen. Harold Metts said, ""Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent."" 
For better or worse, recidivism rates are usually calculated based on how many former inmates are found guilty of a subsequent crime and end up back in prison within three years. 
The most recent data from the Department of Corrections cover two years and the rate is 42 percent. The most recent study to look at a three-year period, which covered inmates released in 2004, put the rate at 54 percent. 
The only way to get above 60 percent is to use the older study and look at an entirely different category: the number of ex-convicts who were brought back to the ACI because they had been charged with a new crime or with violating their probation.

Weatherford defended his key role in blocking federal money to help insure more low-income Floridians by pointing to the effect of all that extra health care spending on the country’s national deficit and debt.

There’s no doubting the federal Medicaid expansion is a lot of dough, with the government slating about $900 billion over 10 years for each state to expand the program, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Ramping up federal spending for Medicaid, one of the biggest long-term deficit-drivers, will not be cheap. 
Weatherford’s commentary, however, is vague. He ignores nonpartisan research showing the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage is offset by other parts of the health care law. And yes, states that decide not to expand Medicaid can prevent more federal spending, but it would just further reduce the deficit -- by how much is unknown -- on top of its already slated contraction.

Weatherford defended his key role in blocking federal money to help insure more low-income Floridians by pointing to the effect of all that extra health care spending on the country’s national deficit and debt.

Weatherford’s commentary, however, is vague. He ignores nonpartisan research showing the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage is offset by other parts of the health care law.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,Says taking millionaires off food stamps and unemployment would save $20 million.,"
Kay Bailey Hutchison, initially elected to the U.S. Senate in 1993, did not seek re-election in 2012. She ran for governor in 2010, losing the Republican nomination to incumbent Rick Perry.
","
As plans to extend a nationwide payroll tax cut worked their way through Congress, Texas’ senior senator fielded a question Dec. 12, 2011, on CNN about how the government could make up for lost revenues -- perhaps $180 billion to $200 billion over ten years.

One proposal that Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison gave: ""We’re going to take millionaires off food stamps and unemployment insurance which, amazingly, would save $20 million.""

Although Congress passed a two-month extension of payroll tax cuts Dec. 23, 2011, the House proposal to extend the cuts for a year awaits consideration -- and it contains the ""millionaire"" modifications. The cuts reduce from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent the amount of eligible earnings taken from Americans’ paychecks to help pay for Social Security.

We wondered if Hutchison was right that taking millionaires off food stamps and unemployment insurance would save $20 million.

We realized, for starters, that millionaires already don’t qualify for food stamps.

PolitiFact reported in a related fact-check Dec. 1, 2011, that the food stamp program, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is only open to households where net income is below the federal poverty level -- this year, $1,863 a month for a household of four. 
One wrinkle: It’s possible that a household with paper assets of $1 million or more could still qualify, still only if its net income is sufficiently low.

By email, U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Aaron Lavallee told us that the department knows of ""only one case and one alleged case involving individuals with assets over $1 million"" getting SNAP benefits. Lavallee said the confirmed case -- a Michigan man who made headlines in May 2011 for using food stamps despite winning $2 million in a lottery -- was removed from the program and the second case is being investigated.

Mindful there’s no savings in barring millionaires from food stamps, we wondered next how many millionaires collect unemployment insurance. Annual counts of millionaires on unemployment, based on IRS data, appeared in an Oct. 1, 2010, Bloomberg news story and a Nov. 13, 2011, report by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma: 
  
The Bloomberg article also tells why millionaires can collect: As insurance, rather than welfare, benefits aren’t paid out according to need but according to whether a person has become unemployed. There’s no income test. 
And how did Hutchison reach her savings figure? Her spokesman Jeff Nelligan sent us a House Ways and Means Committee breakdown of the House’s payroll tax cut proposal, and directed us to the section describing how it would target millionaires by requiring them to pay a 100-percent tax rate on any received unemployment benefits. That is, any benefits received would have to be paid back.

The Ways and Means breakdown says that making millionaires pay back their unemployment benefits would reduce the federal deficit by $20 million over 2012-2021. Citing Congress’ bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the breakdown says that all told, the government would save $127 million in unemployment benefits that it would not have to pay, but lose $107 million in revenue due to fewer millionaires collecting benefits -- partly because some (or all) millionaires won’t apply for unemployment if the provision passes into law. These figures also appeared in a Dec. 9, 2011, Congressional Budget Office report.

Result: The projected savings -- or more precisely, the 10-year decrease in the federal deficit -- is $20 million.

Finally, we wondered why the government would lose $107 million if the anti-millionaire provision becomes law.

Jim Billimoria, communications director for the Ways and Means Committee, told us that when the government writes fewer unemployment checks: ",Sue Owen,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/jan/06/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-getting-millionaires-food-stamps-un/,mostly-true

Election and disability rights experts, along with California’s Secretary of State’s Office, say there’s no evidence showing the program is a security risk. It is subject to the same fraud protections as California’s traditional vote-by-mail program.  Registered voters must apply to use it. Once approved, they use a unique access code to download, complete and print out their ballot. The ballot cannot be submitted online.  Voters are required to sign the outside of their ballot envelope. County elections officials then match that signature with the ones on file to verify each ballot.  Elder’s campaign did not respond to a request for evidence to support the claim about security concerns.

John Cornyn,"""Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states from drug trafficking. Nearly 3,000 Texans died from drug related deaths in 2017 – with half being overdoses involving opioids.""","
John Cornyn is a U.S. senator from Texas, former Texas attorney general and former justice on the Texas Supreme Court. He earlier served as a Bexar County state district judge.
","With this in mind, Cornyn’s figures are accurate, but his ranking of Texas as one of the most impacted states in terms of overdose deaths is based on totals that haven’t been adjusted for population size. Federal figures are in line with numbers Cornyn shared The image Cornyn shared with his tweet cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Brandewie confirmed via email that CDC figures were the basis of Cornyn’s tweet. Numbers published by the agency mirror the figures in Cornyn’s tweet: In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths across the country and 2,989 overdose deaths in Texas. Looking just at overdose deaths in 2017, opioids were involved in 67.8% of deaths nationwide and 48.8% of deaths in Texas. While looking at these numbers, it’s worth considering the fact that not all drug overdose deaths are tied to drug trafficking Courtney Lenard, spokeswoman for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC, provided an analysis of mortality data that showed prescription opioids are associated with opioid overdose deaths. ""Correct, not all drug-related deaths are related to illicit drugs,"" Lenard said. ""However, illicit drugs – particularly illicitly-manufactured fentanyl – are largely driving the overdose epidemic in more recent years."" She said separate analyses conducted by the CDC using mortality data and drug seizure data from the Drug Enforcement Administration ""have suggested an association between states with high or increasing numbers of fentanyl encounters and increases in overdose deaths involving fentanyl."" Cornyn said, ""Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states from drug trafficking. Nearly 3,000 Texans died from drug related deaths in 2017 – with half being overdoses involving opioids."" Cornyn’s tweet as-written includes accurate figures about drug overdose deaths in Texas and across the country, but his characterization of Texas as one of the ""most severely impacted states from drug trafficking"" based on these deaths doesn’t take population into account. Looking at raw figures, Texas was among the states with the most drug-related deaths in 2017. But when we look at the rate of drug-related deaths (which accounts for population), Texas is at the lower end and had fewer drug overdose deaths per capita than 46 other states in 2017. Also: Cornyn’s tweet originated from comments he made at a Senate hearing, which suggested that he was looking at a range of factors when considering the severity of the impact of drug trafficking in Texas, not just drug overdose deaths.

Donald Trump,"""Drug prices are coming down, first time in 51 years because of my administration.""","Donald Trump is the former president of the United States.

Trump's statements were awarded PolitiFact's 2015, 2017 and 2019 Lie of the Year. In November 2022, he announced he would run for president in 2024.","Trump said, ""Drug prices are coming down, first time in 51 years because of my administration."" There is data that could conceivably support the argument that the list prices for some prescription drugs dipped in 2018. But that data doesn’t include many high-priced specialty drugs that drive costs up or the fact that some individual drug prices have increased. Nationally, spending on drugs has continued to climb, even if that growth has slowed. There is also no evidence to support the argument that Trump himself is responsible for changes in drug pricing. After Trump’s Rose Garden speech, we sent the White House press office emails asking if they had any evidence beyond what we reported in our earlier fact-check; we did not get a response. In April, the White House directed us to a 2018 report published by its Council of Economic Advisers pointing to efforts by the Trump administration to bring down prescription costs. Also, the White House sent us data suggesting the consumer price index for prescription drugs declined in January 2019 compared with January 2018.  The White House sent data stating the cost in January was 11 percent below where trends said it should have been. However, the most recent data from the federal government shows a slight uptick: prescription drug prices increased by 0.3% in April 2019 compared to April 2018. It is possible to define time periods in such a way to make the statement — or something close to it — accurate with respect to the prescription drug CPI, said Matthew Fiedler, a health economist at the Brookings Institution. But the CPI is a highly imperfect measure for tracking prescription drug price trends, because it measures list prices rather than net prices. ""For most purposes, net prices are the most economically relevant quantity,"" he said. ""And it’s unclear how much credit the administration really deserves for these trends."" The CPI data doesn’t account for whether manufacturers lowering their list prices have also changed the size of the rebates they provide. Also, this data also doesn’t cover all prescriptions — it only covers drugs sold through retail, or about three-fourths of all prescriptions, and excludes many high-priced specialty meds sold only via mail order. The administration’s proposal to have Medicare pay for physician-administered drugs based on average prices internationally could substantially reduce prices for these drugs, if implemented, Fiedler said. However, when — and even whether — it will ultimately be implemented remains an open question. It’s also worth noting that both the Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary have concluded that one of the administration’s other marquee proposals — a requirement that plans pass rebates through to patients in Medicare Part D — would actually increase drug prices on net, Fiedler said. This proposal looks like it’s on track for implementation in 2020 or 2021. Other measures of drug costs do not support what Trump said. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows total spending on prescription drug prices has climbed during the past several years. (Kaiser Health News, a PolitiFact partner, is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) In 2018, total spending continued to grow, just at a slower pace. That’s a positive trend, experts noted, but it isn’t the same thing as spending going down. Benedic Ippolito, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact that it is a bit challenging to conclusively connect the Trump administration’s actions to substantial reductions in drug prices -- at least not yet, as many of their more consequential proposed reforms have not been implemented. Some manufacturers are reporting that their average net prices have declined in recent years. For example, Janssen, the pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, reported net prices dropped 6.8% in 2018. However, many drug prices have climbed. This year, the list price of more than 3,000 drugs went up, while the price of only 117 went down, according to data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions. Last year, an analysis by the Associated Press revealed that, from January to July, 4,412 branded drug prices went up, while 46 were cut. In April, a White House spokesman pointed to their efforts to bring more generic drugs to market. But experts said it takes time for these products to reach the marketplace, create competition and demonstrate a measurable impact on prices. In May, Trump urged his Department of Health and Human Services to help Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on his priority to adopt a Canadian drug importation program with the goal of bringing down prices for consumers. No HHS secretary has ever issued such an approval. It's also unclear whether such an importation program would bring down prices, since drug manufacturers could cut down on what they sell to Canadian entities supplying drugs to American wholesalers. Trump said, ""Drug prices are coming down, first time in 51 years because of my administration."" There is data that could conceivably support the argument that the list prices for some prescription drugs dipped in 2018. But that data doesn’t include many high-priced specialty drugs that drive costs up or the fact that some individual drug prices have increased.
