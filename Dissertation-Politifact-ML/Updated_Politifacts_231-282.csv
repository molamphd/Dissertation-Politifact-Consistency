Fetterman has not called for releasing one-third of ""dangerous criminals."" In 2020, he said he agreed with what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s corrections secretary that the state’s prison population could be reduced by one-third — without a risk to public safety. Attacking his election opponent as ""crazier than you think,"" Mehmet Oz tweeted an ad to his 3.8 million Twitter followers that made this claim: ""John Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities."" Oz, a physician and former TV talk show host, is the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Fetterman, a Democrat, is the state’s lieutenant governor. The race, rated by campaign watchers as ""tilts Republican"" and a toss-up, could help decide which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Fetterman has touted work to increase the number of pardons issued to prison inmates in Pennsylvania and has called for reducing the prison population in other ways, but we did not find an instance of Fetterman calling for the release of one-third of dangerous criminals. In 2020, Fetterman twice highlighted what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s then-corrections secretary that the state could reduce its prison population by one-third without risking public safety.  Oz tweeted his ad on July 18, the same day his team announced the ad was part of a ""Liberal-O-Meter"" campaign to highlight Fetterman’s ""radical policies and crazy statements.""  It’s not the first time he has made the claim. Oz said in a June 13 speech that Fetterman said, ""We should release one-third of all inmates, including violent offenders."" And in a video ad published on YouTube July 14, Oz said Fetterman ""supports releasing one-third of the prison population."" To back up the claim, Oz’s campaign referred PolitiFact to a June 22 article in the conservative-leaning Daily Caller and to two Fetterman tweets cited in the article. The article said Fetterman twice in 2020 ""appeared to endorse"" releasing one-third of the state’s prison population.  In May 2020, Fetterman tweeted: ""PA’s Correction Secretary has said: ‘We could reduce our prison population by 1/3 and not make anyone less safe.’"" And in July 2020, he tweeted: ""Our Corrections Secretary has said we could"" release ""1/3 of our inmates and not make anyone less safe. What if we directed those savings into our state schools?""  The corrections secretary was John Wetzel, who was appointed to the post in 2011 by Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. In announcing in September 2021 that Wetzel would leave the post, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, praised Wetzel for reducing the state’s prison population. PolitiFact searched Google, the Nexis news archive, and Wetzel’s Twitter account, and did not find an instance in which Wetzel made such a statement, so we asked Fetterman’s campaign about the Wetzel remarks. Spokesperson Joe Calvello responded that the campaign could not find the exact quote, but that Wetzel has made similar comments, such as in 2021, when Wetzel advocated for medical parole for elderly inmates, saying most who would be eligible ""are incapacitated and not a security threat."" Calvello said that Fetterman was not expressing an opinion on releasing one-third of its inmates but was citing Wetzel’s comments to highlight the cost of Pennsylvania’s prison system.  We tried to reach Wetzel via LinkedIn and his consultant agency on Facebook, but got no reply. On Aug. 17, Fox News posted a story that linked to a video from an Oct. 7, 2020, panel discussion on reducing incarceration. In that video, Celeste Trusty of the Families Against Mandatory Minimums advocacy group asked Fetterman about reducing the number of prison inmates in Pennsylvania age 50 and over.  Fetterman said, ""We’re actively trying to audit our population to identify those inmates that are most deserving and does it make sense."" He said he agreed with a statement he attributed to Wetzel that ""we could reduce our prison population by a third and not make anyone less safe in Pennsylvania."" Fetterman has called for ""second chances"" for offenders, such as eliminating mandatory life-without-parole sentences for certain murder convictions and for other criminal justice reforms. Fetterman’s campaign website includes one video promoting his record as lieutenant governor in increasing pardons for prison inmates in Pennsylvania; in the other video, Fetterman calls for overhauling the criminal justice system, saying, ""There are individuals that, quite frankly, don’t need to be in prison, it doesn’t make anyone more safe."" Pennsylvania ranked 25th among states in the number of people incarcerated in state prisons per 100,000 residents, based on 2019 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics data, according to The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that works to minimize imprisonment. Oz said Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities."" Fetterman has not called for releasing one-third of ""dangerous criminals.""

She represented Virginia Beach in the House of Delegates from 2002 to 2004 but did not seek reelection, opting to launch an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House of Repesentatives in 2004. ","Earle-Sears said, ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 — that’s real money, that’s going-to-jail money — to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system.""  Earle-Sears has a little ground beneath her. In 2020, the school system paid a consultant $34,167 to conduct seminars for senior officials on critical race theory and equity training.  But her statement is otherwise tenuous. The seminars were a slice of $422,500 Loudoun spent to improve racial equity in its school amid reports that disproportionate numbers of Black students were being suspended or expelled. The money was spent from September 2018 to June 2020 — not last year as Earle-Sears says. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears recently told Fox News that critical race theory ""is definitely being taught in some form or fashion,"" in Virginia’s public schools. ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 — that’s real money, that’s going-to-jail money — to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system,"" Earle-Sears, a Republican, said in a Jan. 17 interview.  Critical race theory — a 45-year-old academic construct about systemic bias and privilege — has become a political flashpoint across the nation. It holds that racism is part of a broader pattern in America: It is woven into laws, and it shows up in who gets a job interview, the sort of home loans people are offered, how they are treated by police and other facets of daily life large and small. There is a movement by some educators to incorporate critical race theory into instruction, particularly in U.S. history which they say has been taught from a white vantage point. Conservatives in Virginia and across the nation have strongly opposed teaching the theory, saying because the approach focuses on race, it is fundamentally racist. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said in his campaign last fall that the theory has infiltrated Virginia schools and vowed to end its spread. Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 15, Youngkin signed an executive order banning ""the use"" of critical race theory.  He has set up a hotline for parents to report the teaching of the theory and other ""divisive practices"" in schools. Critics say there is no evidence the theory is being widely taught in Virginia and Youngkin and his supporters have struggled to provide proof. We asked Earle-Sears’ office for the source of her claim about Loudoun’s $300,000 investment in critical race theory and were sent two news articles: Both articles refer to money Loudoun paid The Equity Collaborative, a California-based consulting group, to interview students, parents and teachers and make recommendations on how the racial atmosphere and policies in schools could be improved.  The Collaborative was paid $422,500 between September 2018 and June 2020, according to county records. No payments were made to the consultant last year, as Earle-Sears claimed.   There’s much debate over the contention of Earle-Sears and others that the money was spent ""to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system."" Wayde Byard, spokesman for Loudoun schools, told us the county paid $34,167 in June 2020 for seminars on critical race theory. He said the purpose was to familiarize senior officials with the theory and that no additional money was spent on CRT. Loudoun Superintendent Scott Ziegler says the theory is not being taught to students. He says critics are conflating the theory with Loudoun’s efforts to bring equity to the way students are treated in school, where most of the money was spent. The Collaborative charged the county $242,000 to interview students, parents and teachers about the racial climate in schools and what could make them more welcoming to minorities. The consultants were paid for conducting equity leadership seminars designed to help teachers relate to minorities, as well as travel. Loudoun’s school system has seen huge growth and demographic change in recent decades. It is no longer majority White. The system began its equity work amid reports that found Black students were being inordinately suspended and expelled. The Collaborative released a 28-page report in June 2019 that did not mention critical race theory. It concluded that Loudoun teachers and principals had a ""low level of racial consciousness,"" discipline of Black students was disproportionately severe and that many minority students encountered racial slurs and violent actions from other students. Based on the findings, Loudoun drew up a 22-page ""Plan to Combat Systemic Racism."" It called for teacher training in racial literacy and competence, a ban on students wearing Confederate flag items and the development of alternative punishments to suspension and expulsion, which are shown to severely harm student outcomes.  While Loudoun draws a distinction between critical race theory and its equity program, critics of the school system do not. ""They’re using semantics, the other side is, when it comes to CRT and it’s definitely being taught in some form or another,"" Earle-Sears told Fox News. Earle-Sears said, ""We know last year the Loudoun County School Board spent about $300,000 — that’s real money, that’s going-to-jail money — to bring CRT in some form or fashion to the school system.""  Earle-Sears has a little ground beneath her.

There are many criticisms of this process, including that it took too long to give states money to implement their plans and a lack of communication from the top about how the rollout would work.

Facebook posts,"“Trump denies fire assistance to California because they didn't vote for him, but helped Russia with their wildfires in Siberia.”","Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","President Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal wildfire assistance to California, including last week as hundreds of lightning-sparked blazes burned across the state’s northern and central regions. He’s also made numerous false and oversimplified claims about what’s driving these infernos, reducing the complex matter to a need to remove ""leaves, debris and fallen trees,"" from the forest floor.  But has Trump ever ""denied fire assistance"" to the Golden State? And did he really help Russia with their fires in Siberia?  That’s the claim in a viral Facebook post published Aug. 23:   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook).  We decided to douse this fiery claim with a bucket of facts.  Did Trump ‘Deny’ Fire Aid To California?  Trump’s most recent threat to withhold assistance was Aug. 20 during a campaign speech in Pennsylvania: ""Maybe we're just going to have to make them pay for it, because they don't listen to us,"" Trump said at the event. ""We say, you've got to get rid of the leaves. You've got to get rid of the debris. You've got to get rid of the fallen trees."" Forestry and fire experts say dense material on forest floors can make fires worse. But that’s not what’s driving them. California’s extreme heat, a siege of lightning strikes and low humidity all combined to cause the current blazes, Keith Gilless, chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection said last week. Given Trump’s repeated criticism of the state, some might assume he withheld the aid. But he didn’t.  Two days after the president’s threat, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the White House had approved the state’s request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration. The approval helps fire victims with crisis counseling, housing, unemployment assistance and legal services.   ""It also provides federal assistance to help state, tribal and local governments fund emergency response, recovery and protective measures,"" Newsom’s announcement reads. The same day Trump threatened to withhold aid, Newsom thanked the Trump administration for its help. He told the Associated Press that he has a ""strong personal relationship with the president."" ""While he may make statements publicly, the working relationship privately has been a very effective one,"" Newsom said, according to the AP.  Earlier in the month, on Aug. 18, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a news release it had ""authorized the use of federal funds"" to help the state fight the LNU Lightning Complex fire. As of Aug. 27, that set of fires in Napa, Lake, Solano and Yolo counties had burned nearly 369,000 acres, killed five people, injured four, destroyed 1,080 structures and damaged another 272, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It was threatening another 30,500 structures and was 35% contained.  It is one of several massive fires burning in the state.  As for the post’s claim California ""didn’t vote"" for Trump, that is correct. Hillary Clinton received 61.5% of the state’s vote in the 2016 presidential election and nearly 4.3 million more votes than Trump. Did Trump Help Russia ‘With Their Wildfires In Siberia’?  It’s not clear Trump actually helped Russia with wildfires that burned across Siberia last year. But both Trump and Russia say he offered to. As Snopes.com reported last year, the Russian government published a statement about a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 31, 2019: The statement reads: ""Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with US President Donald Trump this evening at the American side’s initiative. The US President offered help in putting out wildfires in Siberia. The President of Russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance."" In the statement, Putin goes on to say he would accept the offer ""if it becomes necessary."" At a press conference the next day later, Trump told reporters he offered Russia help.  ""Mostly we discussed the forest fires in Siberia, and other parts of Russia. And I said, look, we have the greatest equipment, if we could help you let us know. Large sections are burning, and so I said to President Putin, if we can help you, let me know,"" Trump said.  We did not find any evidence he followed through and provided assistance to combat the fires in Siberia.  Our Rating A widely-shared Facebook post claims President Trump ""denied fire assistance"" to California but helped Russia with its wildfires in Siberia.  Trump has repeatedly said he would withhold fire assistance to the state, including last week as a set of massive blazes burned in California. But he didn’t follow through in the past or this time. Instead, we found announcements showing the White House approved federal assistance.  Last year, Trump said he offered Russia help in Siberia, but we found no evidence that he followed through on that pledge, either.  In the end, the viral post plays on some assumptions about Trump — that he disdains left-leaning California but supports the authoritarian Russian Federation. The problem is it takes some big and inaccurate leaps in the process.  A widely-shared Facebook post claims President Trump ""denied fire assistance"" to California but helped Russia with its wildfires in Siberia.  Trump has repeatedly said he would withhold fire assistance to the state, including last week as a set of massive blazes burned in California.

Michael Caputo,“Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?”,Michael Caputo is the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. Caputo is a former adviser to Donald Trump. He also ran Carl Paladino's 2010 gubernatorial campaign.,"In a tweet, the HHS assistant secretary for public affairs said that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""forced"" nursing homes across the state to admit COVID-positive patients and that this policy fueled the spread of COVID-19 that led to thousands of deaths in the nursing home population. Although nursing homes felt pressure to accept COVID-positive patients, they were not actually forced to do so. State regulations require nursing homes to accept patients only if they can care for them, and they could have refused them on those grounds. In addition, it’s unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Infection control is a longstanding problem in nursing homes that predates the pandemic and a report showed peak numbers of nursing home deaths came prior to the peak influx of patients as a result of Cuomo’s advisory. While the introduction of COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on infection spread, Caputo’s statement suggests it was solely responsible. That’s not what the evidence shows. On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was among the first in a weeklong parade of speakers to issue scathing critiques of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response. Cuomo’s criticisms drew a quick reply in a tweet from Michael R. Caputo, an assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. ""Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?"" he wrote. It was an easy jab: Cuomo has been dogged by criticism for months over his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. As long as they were medically stable, the notice said, it was appropriate to move patients in. Further, nursing homes were prohibited from requiring that medically stable prospective residents be tested for the virus before they arrived. Between March 25 and May 8, approximately 6,326 COVID-positive patients were admitted to nursing homes, according to a state health department report. While experts say this policy was flawed, is it fair to say that the governor’s directive ""forced"" nursing homes to take patients who were sick with COVID-19? And to what extent did that strategy sow the seeds of disease and death? When we examined the evidence, we found it was less clear cut than the statement makes it seem. The policy likely had an effect, but epidemiologists identified additional factors that fed the problem. What’s more the policy did not ""force"" nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients. Nursing homes interpreted it this way.  We checked with HHS to find the basis for Caputo’s comment but got no response. As the virus tore through nursing homes, killing dozens at some of them, Cuomo came under withering censure. His administration’s policy, implemented with an eye toward freeing up hospital beds for an onslaught of COVID patients, seemed to disregard the risks to frail and elderly nursing home residents who were especially vulnerable to the disease. According to the COVID Tracking Project, 6,624 people have died of COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in New York, accounting for 26% of the state’s 25,275 COVID deaths. Some say the true number of deaths is much higher because, unlike many states, New York does not count the deaths of former nursing home residents who are transferred to hospitals and die there as nursing home deaths.

 ","A Facebook post said, ""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity."" A lawsuit does seek to temporarily ban Donald Trump and his three eldest children from being part of charities in New York. But that case is still pending.  The lawsuit relates to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, not to a kids cancer charity. The lawsuit alleges that Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations of entities he controlled, to promote his hotels, to buy personal items, and to support his presidential election campaign. Trump’s son, Eric, led a foundation that raised money for kids with cancer, and that foundation has come under scrutiny over its own handling of funds. But the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps from participating in charities isn’t pegged to Eric Trump’s foundation. What follows is the original post: A pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily being involved in charities in New York. But a Facebook post takes it further by claiming that the family has already been ""disallowed."" That hasn’t happened. ""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity,"" said the Oct. 8 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 43,000 times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In June 2018, the New York Attorney General (then Barbara Underwood) filed a lawsuit against Trump and three of his adult children — Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric F. Trump — and against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws related to charities in the state of New York. Trump founded the foundation and served as its president; his three eldest children were on the board of directors. ""This pattern of illegal conduct by the foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law,"" the lawsuit said. As a result, the lawsuit sought to dissolve the foundation and to temporarily prohibit the Trumps from future service in New York not-for-profit or charitable organizations. Specifically, the lawsuit wants to ban Trump’s involvement for ten years and the three Trump children for one year. The Trump children’s ban would be subject to suspension if they undergo training on related fiduciary duties. The Donald J. Trump Foundation in December 2018 agreed to dissolve. But the legal case is still ongoing. A spokesperson for the Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James said the office could not comment on the pending case. The Facebook post includes a picture of Trump and his son, Eric, posing for what appears to have been an event for the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. St. Jude treats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The Eric Trump Foundation raised money for St. Jude.  Eric Trump’s foundation has also come under scrutiny, but the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps’ involvement in New York charities is not tied to the Eric Trump Foundation. Forbes has reported that Eric Trump’s foundation gave donors the impression that all funds it raised at an annual golf event went to St. Jude, yet more than $500,000 went to other causes; and that at least four groups that received donations from Eric Trump’s foundation later paid for golf tournaments at Trump-owned courses. Eric Trump in December 2016 resigned from his own foundation, and the foundation restructured and rebranded itself as Curetivity.

Klobuchar’s statement hinged largely on unreliable data for jails. The only credible data we can use, for prisons, shows the African-American incarceration rate fell by 12 percent, and the admission rate fell by 22 percent. That's a drop, but both are well below 65 percent. Experts said that Klobuchar’s policies could have contributed to the decline, though other factors beyond her control could have made a difference as well. Public sentiment about criminal justice policy has evolved in recent years, putting pressure on the former prosecutors who are running for president to answer for their records in the judicial system, particularly about any racial disparities in arrests and sentencing. We previously reviewed the criminal justice record of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who served as both the district attorney for San Francisco and the state attorney general for California. Now, the scrutiny is coming for Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who served as county attorney of Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, between 1999 and 2007.

Ron DeSantis,"""I’ve already traveled to Washington, D.C., and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered.""","Ron DeSantis won the race for Florida governor in 2018 and 2022. DeSantis, a Republican, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and resigned in September 2018 to focus on his campaign. He represented Florida's 6th Congressional District which is south of St. Augustine and north of Orlando and includes Daytona Beach. DeSantis initially ran for U.S. Senate in 2016 but dropped out after Marco Rubio decided to seek re-election.","DeSantis said, ""I’ve already traveled to Washington, D.C. and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered."" DeSantis provided no details in his speech, but he was referring to his effort in January to get Trump to extend the amount of time the federal government would pick up the tab for debris removal and emergency protective measures from five to 45 days. DeSantis got a verbal commitment from Trump to make that happen, but we were unable to confirm that with FEMA. A spokeswoman for DeSantis says the ""historic commitment"" is that such an extension is unusual for Florida. But we found that it’s not unusual for the president to tack on extensions even for months that the federal government will pick up the entire tab. In his campaign for governor, Ron DeSantis promised Florida voters that his personal relationship with President Donald Trump would pay off for the state. A little more than two months since taking office, DeSantis claims it already has. DeSantis used part of his first State of the State speech March 5 to trumpet news of a ""historic commitment"" from the Trump administration to help repair parts of the Panhandle that Hurricane Michael battered in October. ""I’ve already traveled to Washington, D.C., and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered,"" DeSantis said. Is that true? Part of the answer, PolitiFact Florida found, relies on a handshake agreement between the governor and president. The other part about it being it ""historic"" is more easily understood, and wrong. After Michael barreled through the areas around Mexico Beach, federal emergency management officials said the federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for a period five days. After that, the federal government would cover 75 percent of the costs. DeSantis asked Trump to extend 100 percent federal coverage for 45 days. ""Debris remains pervasive, and thousands of businesses are still struggling to reopen,"" DeSantis wrote to Trump, saying the state had already spent $1 billion. DeSantis met with Trump at the White House in January and said Trump granted his request. The agreement between Trump and DeSantis remains a verbal one, however. DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferre told PolitiFact Florida the state does not have written confirmation, and FEMA media relations headquarters did not respond to our requests for days. Shortly after our fact-check initially posted, a FEMA spokeswoman told us that the agency was aware of the announcement by DeSantis regarding the increase in the federal cost share and that the request was in process. She did not elaborate. Local governments we talked to are proceeding as if the deal is done. Bay County, for example, submitted for reimbursement March 8. County spokeswoman Valerie Sale said she expects the project will be covered at the current federal share of 75 percent and will be adjusted on subsequent projects if or when the federal share is modified. According to Sale, her county heard from a FEMA official, Nelson Santos, who said FEMA was working on codifying the change into the Federal Register. We reached Santos by email to confirm. ""The only confirmation I made clear to Bay County consultants is the 5-days to 45-days extension,"" Santos, a FEMA program delivery manager, told PolitiFact in an email. ""It has not been determined or official as of yet what the cost share will be."" The best answer we could get from FEMA by deadline was that DeSantis’ request remains in process and has not yet been determined. The extension would be a ""game changer,"" Bay County Commission Chairman Philip ""Griff"" Griffitts told PolitiFact, saving county taxpayers there an estimated $85 million. Tanya Castro, administrator of hard-hit Mexico Beach, said that her city was advised verbally by state and FEMA officials that it will receive the full amount of its reimbursement, but she didn’t have any formal documentation. Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey praised efforts by DeSantis to help his coastal community including $2.8 million in state money for debris cleanup. So far, FEMA provided about $2 million for cleanup. But Cathey said his city needs more money. ""We need it fast,"" he said. Assuming the extension will occur, it’s not as historic as DeSantis let on. In 2017, Trump authorized 100 percent coverage for Puerto Rico for 180 days following Hurricane Maria. He later extended the amount of time to 90 days for debris and 60 days for emergency protective measures. He also authorized 100 percent coverage for the Virgin Islands for emergency protective measures for 30 days following Hurricane Irma. Trump then extended his order for 60 days, both for debris removal and emergency protective measures in response to hurricanes Maria and Irma. Trump was not the first president to do this. President George W. Bush gave the go-ahead for extensions that provided 100 percent coverage for months in Louisiana and Mississippi. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the federal Stafford Act allows the president to reduce or eliminate the share of cost borne by local or state entities, Ellis said. ""I wouldn’t call that historic,"" Ellis said. ""It has been done before."" When we told DeSantis’ office about we learned, she clarified that this was the first time in Florida history that a newly elected governor received the president’s commitment to increase the 100 percent coverage from five to 45 days. ""We are not aware of any time in Florida history where a hurricane received this many days at 100 percent reimbursement other than the three storms in 2005, which were considered as a group,"" Ferre said. ""This is a historic extension for Florida. Gov. DeSantis has the commitment from the president of the United States, who is the only one who can authorize it."" Meanwhile, some federal lawmakers have expressed frustration that despite efforts by both chambers, the budget deal Trump signed in February to end the shutdown included no disaster relief. ""Florida’s Panhandle needs help now, not six months down the road,"" said U.S. Rep. Neal Dunn, a Republican from northwest Florida. DeSantis said, ""I’ve already traveled to Washington, D.C. and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered.""

On the confiscation side, she noted that the registry was limited and far from comprehensive. Contrary to what Simmons said, Hitler didn’t take everyone’s weapons and the registry at the time was so incomplete that many Jews retained their weapons. Furthermore, Simmons miscasts the connection between Hitler’s gun policies and the events of June 30, 1934.

Portman said no to background checks on all purchases,"" the ad’s soldier continues. ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" That last statement caught our attention.  No, Portman did not vote to allow suspected terrorists to purchase guns. The attack obscures what really happened. The ad cites Senate voting records from June 20 and 23. First, we’ll consult the record. Votes 106 and 109 were two of four votes on gun control measures considered by the Senate after the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. On June 12, Omar Mateen, a man who had twice been investigated by the FBI for suspected terrorist ties, killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.. Vote 106 asked senators to vote to end the debate, or to keep debating, an amendment by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein which would authorize the U.S. attorney general to deny requests to sell firearms to ""known or suspected terrorists."" Portman voted ""nay,"" a vote against bringing the issue up for passage or failure. The week ahead of that vote, Portman told reporters in his weekly media conference call, ""I do believe that you should not be able to buy a weapon when you’re on the (terrorist) watch list."" Strickland’s ad doesn’t mention the other three votes taken that day, June 20, 2016, on the issue of suspected terrorists and gun sales. All four measures failed, largely along party lines. Portman voted in favor of Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley’s amendment to ""address gun violence and improve the availability of records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System."" He also voted in favor of Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s proposal, an alternative to Feinstein’s measure to prevent watchlisted terrorists from buying guns. The main difference between the Feinstein amendment and the one proposed by Cornyn had to do with due process -- granting an avenue for an individual to appeal if they are wrongfully listed as a terror suspect and denied a gun purchase. The Republican amendment allowed authorities to detain a terrorism suspect who tries to obtain a firearm, and gave a judge 72 hours to determine whether there was enough proof to bar the gun sale. Feinstein’s amendment provided for an individual to appeal to the Justice Department if they felt they were wrongfully listed and barred from buying a gun. It did not have a three-day limit for the government to make its case. Republicans argued that Cornyn’s amendment, with a stronger check-and-balance requiring a court order, was necessary in light of well-known errors on federal no-fly and terrorist watch lists. Former Sen. Ted Kennedy is often cited as an example after he was erroneously stopped for extra airport security checks because ""T. Kennedy"" was an alias used by a terror suspect. A motion to table a tweaked version of Feinstein’s amendment, proposed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine -- the ""Vote 109"" referenced by Strickland’s ad -- failed on June 23 with a 46-52 vote, short of the 60 votes required to advance. Portman voted ""yea,"" or against the amendment, in line with all but eight Republicans. Our ruling Strickland’s campaign ad said of Portman, ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" The ad distorts facts on many levels. People on the terrorism watch list could already buy guns before the votes in question. Portman voted along party lines on the gun control measures that came up for Senate vote on June 20 and 23. He voted against Feinstein’s amendment to enact a blanket ban on firearm purchases by terrorists or suspected terrorists. But he voted for the Republican version of the legislation, sponsored by Cornyn, that would ban a gun sale after a three-day period of judicial review to determine whether an individual was on a watch list for legitimate reasons.

Dan Flynn,"""Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in"" Texas ""in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years.""","
Dan Flynn represents Texas' second district in the Texas House.
","Thirteen legislators charged Texas authorities with unwarranted interference--in milk deliveries. At issue: Whether consumers may legally designate an agent to bring raw--meaning unpasteurized--milk from a farm to a pickup spot. State law says licensed producers may sell raw milk to retail customers where the milk is produced. Our curiosity was stirred, though, by the legislators suggesting raw milk rarely poses a health risk. After all, pasteurization kills the bacteria responsible for diseases including typhoid fever, tuberculosis and diphtheria. Still, the lawmakers said in their September 2016 letter to the Texas Department of State Health Services: ""Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in our state in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years."" Do those counts hold up? The letter, we determined, failed to account for up to 10 suspected illnesses in 2015 due to drinking raw milk. Before then, it appears, there were indeed a handful of identified illnesses. Flynn: Two illnesses in 2000, four in 2011 When we asked the letter’s lead author, Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Van, how he reached his conclusion about no illnesses in more than four years and just six in 20 years, an aide, Kelli Linza, emailed us a chart citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The chart included an entry stating the agency confirmed two Texas illnesses, both in February 2000, traced to drinking unpasteurized milk. Linza later told us Flynn also recognized four 2011 cases of salmonellosis allegedly linked by State Health Services to raw milk from a North Texas dairy. Agencies: Seven to 10 illnesses in 2015 Next, we emailed the CDC about such Texas illnesses; spokeswoman Brittany Behm pointed us to its database of foodborne outbreaks enabling us to glean, clicks later, that from 2005 through 2015, Texas had two suspected outbreaks and seven illnesses (but no deaths) attributed to raw milk--all in March and April 2015. Nationally in the decade-plus, the government tallied more than 421 illnesses and one death linked to raw milk, according to our database search. Closer to home, we asked State Health Services about the frequency of illnesses tied to drinking raw milk. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen replied by email that in 2015, ""raw milk was the suspected source of at least 10 reported cases of illness in Texas. ""As is frequently the case with foodborne illness investigations,"" his reply continued, ""we weren’t able to test the milk consumed by the people who got sick, so we can’t say 100 percent definitively that raw milk was the cause. Often, by the time someone gets sick and an investigation occurs, the food has been eaten or discarded, so there’s no longer product available to test. ""Also, it’s worth noting that only a small percentage of foodborne illnesses are diagnosed and reported, so there may be additional cases out there that we don’t ever find out about,"" Van Deusen wrote. We circled back to Flynn about the reported illnesses from 2015. By email, Linza expressed concern that the suspected 2015 instances of illness linked to raw milk that we found didn’t show up in what Flynn fetched from the CDC in July 2016. Linza, asked whether Flynn asked State Health Services to tally raw-milk illnesses, said she didn’t remember doing so. Separately, Van Deusen affirmatively answered our inquiry about whether the count of 10 suspected 2015 illnesses linked to raw milk would have been available to anyone asking the agency about such illnesses in July 2016, which was when Flynn queried the CDC. National hospitalizations, deaths Nationally, we found in an online search, the Food and Drug Administration tallied 133 health incidents  from 1987 to September 2010 due to raw milk or raw milk products, accounting for 269 hospitalizations, three deaths, six stillbirths and two miscarriages. Also, CDC research published in 2012 found that ""between 1993 and 2006, more than 1,500 people in the United States became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk."" According to the CDC study, states where the sale of raw milk was legal had more than twice the rate of outbreaks as states where it was illegal. The 30 states where raw milk sales were legal at the end of the study in 2011 included about a dozen states, like Texas, that allowed raw milk sales only on the farm where the milk was produced. Then again, a chart with the study says the identified outbreaks occurred in 25 states--with no outbreaks in Texas:                          SOURCE: Study, ""Increased Outbreaks Associated with Nonpasteurized Milk, United States, 2007–2012,"" Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, in journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, January 2015 (accessed Sept. 19, 2016) We also spotted a nongovernmental website funded by a Washington state law firm that represents food-poisoning victims. When we peeked, the site, realrawmilkfacts.com, had a chart itemizing 2,468 U.S. illnesses and two deaths from June 1998 through October 2013, all attributed to raw milk products. By phone, Bill Marler, managing partner for the Marler Clark law firm, told us the firm doesn’t have a hand in the figures, relying instead on California researchers. In Texas, the chart indicates, four residents took ill with salmonella in November 2010 after ingesting raw cow milk from a farm store. In April 2011, Dallas County’s Health and Human Services Department said a 56-year-old resident had been hospitalized after drinking unpasteurized milk. The agency said that since November 2010, three other similar cases of illness linked to raw milk had been investigated by the state. Previously, per the Real Raw Milk Facts chart, a June 2005 Texas outbreak involved a dozen residents who ate cheese made from raw milk. Before that, in February 2005, two Texas residents took ill from eating cheese made from raw milk, the chart indicates, with another 14 Texas illnesses attributed to raw milk in 2000 and 2003 (when one person died). Our ruling Flynn wrote: ""Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in"" Texas ""in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years."" Government counts suggest raw milk only rarely touched off illnesses in Texas over those decades. However, Flynn presented an incomplete too-low count, failing to note seven to 10 illnesses tied to raw milk that reportedly occurred in Texas last year.

Greg Abbott declared: ""If Texas were a country, it would have the 10th highest GDP in the world."" If so, that’s gained ground. When we looked into a 2012 claim comparing productivity in Texas versus the nations of the world, Texas ranked 14th internationally. So, we decided to put Abbott’s statement to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. The fine print in Abbott’s tweet states that it's based on information from Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, and from the International Monetary Fund and Bureau of Economic Analysis. When we asked, Lauren Willis of the comptroller’s office emailed us its chart indicating that in 2015, Texas had a gross domestic product of $1.59 trillion -- placing it 10th among countries behind the U.S. ($17.95 trillion) and eight countries including Brazil ($1.77 trillion). The chart shows Texas ahead of No. 11 Canada ($1.55 trillion) as well as Korea, Russia, Australia, Spain, Mexico and four other countries. GDP, the most-used measure of national economic output, is defined as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in country.  SOURCE: Email, Lauren Willis, director of communications, Office of Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Sept. 6, 2016 For our part, we found 2015 GDP figures posted in April 2016 by the International Monetary Fund matching the GDP figures in the comptroller’s chart. Willis also pointed out a World Bank breakout of GDPs by nation for 2015; the presented figures didn’t perfectly align with the comptroller’s chart, we found, though the ranking of the top 10 countries did.  Willis also sent a web link to the bureau’s U.S. and state-by-state GDP figures for 2015 and previous years. From the BEA, we downloaded figures indicating that in 2015, Texas had the GDP of $1.59 trillion that Abbott relied on. Then again, more populous California had a GDP of $2.46 trillion, which would have placed the Golden State No. 6 in the world if it were a nation, nudging Texas to No. 11. We recently found too that California in 2015 had greater per-capita productivity than Texas.  SOURCE: Website, ""Regional Economic Accounts, Gross Domestic Product, Interactive Tables"" Bureau of Economic Analysis, last updated June 14, 2016 (GDP figures downloaded Sept. 6, 2016) Our ruling Abbott said that if Texas were a country, its economy would rank 10th in the world. That’s so, figures show, if you leave out a bigger state, California. Considering California, in fairness, Texas would rank 11th in the world.

Bike Austin,"""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets.""","Bike Austin, an advocacy group, says its mission is to ""improves quality of life for all of Austin and Central Texas by growing bicycling as a form of transportation, exercise, and recreation.""
","After a 14-year-old bicyclist was hit by a car and killed in Austin in June 2016, local nonprofit Bike Austin called on the city to make streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. In a statement, the group’s executive director, Mercedes Feris, said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Does that hold up? Group cites city report To our inquiry, Feris cited a 2015 City of Austin report, ""Redesigning the Street: A Report on Right-Sizing Projects in Austin, TX 1999-2014,"" analyzing the effects of a certain kind of project, called a road diet, designed to make streets safer by shrinking opportunities to drive too fast. In what the Federal Highway Administration calls the classic example of a road diet, lane lines on a four-lane road that has two lanes in each direction are repainted to create a three-lane road, leaving a single lane in each direction and a center lane solely for left turns. A 2014 agency guide to road diets says the concept developed decades ago in response to the expansion-minded road construction of the 1950s and 1960s, when two-lane roads were frequently upgraded to four lanes. One of the first road diets, the guide says, was applied in 1979 to a four-lane road in Billings, Montana. On that road, where about 10,000 cars drove every day, the shrinkage to three lanes was found to reduce crashes without increasing delays. We dug into Austin’s more recent report and checked with experts on road diets and bicycle transportation. From that, we found that such projects often incorporate new bike lanes -- but they don’t typically add sidewalks. Generally, too, the highway administration has found that crashes in which a car hits a pedestrian walking on the side of the road consistently fall by more than 50 percent when sidewalks are installed. We failed to identify research tying the addition of simple, striped bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. The cited city report covers 37 local road diets completed from 1999 through 2014, including the one that Feris pointed out, on a 1.6-mile stretch of Manor Road in Northeast Austin. It resulted, the report says, in a 38 percent drop in crashes. A city spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, responded to our inquiry about the research, saying by email the 38 percent reduction in any kind of crash ties to nearly six years of data collected by the Austin Police Department before and after the road diet took place on the stretch of Manor Road between Theo Drive and East 51st Street in November 2010.  A close-up aerial view from along the noted 1.6-mile segment of Manor Road after the road diet was completed. The road includes bike lanes and the hallmark of a road diet project: a center two-way left-turn lane. SOURCE: Google Earth. Monroy told us that in the three years before the project, from November 2007 through October 2010, the to-be-reconfigured section had 39 crashes involving any combination of motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians--adding up to one pedestrian death and 16 injury crashes involving motor vehicles. In the three years after the project, from December 2010 through November 2013, she said, the stretch had 24 crashes -- or 38.5 percent fewer -- with no fatalities and 14 injury crashes, one involving a pedestrian, two affecting bicyclists. It’s also worth mentioning, as the city report says, that bike traffic on the segment increased 180 percent, from 54 bikes tallied in a 24-hour period before the project (and its bike lanes) was completed with 151 bikes in a similar period after. The full report presents general crash-reduction analyses for five of the 37 projects. Among the five, it sums up, ""right-sizing projects,"" or road diets, contributed to at least 22 percent fewer crashes, on Amherst Drive, up to the nearly 39 percent reduction on the Manor Road stretch. We calculated the average of the five: 28.8 percent fewer crashes. Expert: Road diets reduce accidents For outside perspective, we reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, hearing back about road diets, bike lanes and sidewalks from Joan Hudson, an associate research engineer. Hudson advised that the noted 38 percent reduction in crashes falls in line with national research she’s reviewed, also pointing us to the highway administration and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program -- a division of the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Each agency highlights the same two studies finding ""the road-diet treatment had a significant effect"" in reducing crashes, as the cooperative research program said in a 2008 report. The reductions ranged from 19 to 47 percent, with an average of 29 percent. Hudson said road diets make roads safer for a few reasons: additional space improves reaction time, and a narrower roadway tends to reduce how fast drivers go, making crashes less severe. Road diets also make bicyclists more comfortable, she said, because they have dedicated space instead of sharing lanes with cars. The city’s report also reflected these points. Hudson confirmed that most road diets include bike lanes, but said sidewalks -- posing greater costs than what it takes to revise lane lines -- are hardly ever included. (It looks to us like a sidewalk may have been installed on the Manor Road stretch. To our query, Monroy said she couldn’t confirm it was part of the related road-diet project.) And by phone, Hudson told us that determining how much road diets reduce crashes involving bicyclists or pedestrians is hard because there’s not much data measuring bicycle and pedestrian traffic before and after roads are relined. It may be, for instance, she said, that bike accidents escalate after a project is completed largely because more bicyclists use the added bike lanes. That looks to us like what happened on the on the Manor Road stretch, where bike traffic more than doubled with bike crashes only slightly going up. Bike lanes alone? We wondered if perhaps bike lanes alone result in double-digit crash reductions. To our inquiry, a University of Wisconsin urban planning professor, Robert Schneider, said by email that ""it is difficult to make a specific statement"" about how a particular bike lane reduces crashes, because that’s not what researches examine. Schneider, who teaches about pedestrian and bike safety, said research tends to be broader, looking at what experts call ""networks"" -- routes through whole cities or significant parts of cities -- to determine how easy and safe it is to get around on a bike. Research examining those networks, Schneider said, shows that bike-friendly cities help drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians stay safe. He cited a 2011 study from two engineers at the University of Colorado-Denver finding that when intersections and roads are easier for cyclists to navigate and more cyclists hit the road, drivers tend to slow down and be more aware of their surroundings. A Bike Austin leader, Miller Nuttle, informed of our findings, said its claim wasn’t worded as precisely as it should have been. Our ruling Bike Austin said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Research suggests big drops in pedestrian-vehicle accidents when sidewalks are introduced. But Bike Austin didn’t offer nor did we find research showing the addition of bike lanes in themselves or bike lanes plus sidewalks resulted in any percentage plummet in crashes. Instead, the city analysis states that reconfiguring lanes on part of one road, which also gained bike lanes, preceded 38 percent fewer crashes--with crash reductions averaging 29 percent among five road-diet projects.

She served as U.S. Secretary of State during the first four years of the Obama administration. She is formerly a U.S. senator from New York, first elected in 2000. She was a candidate for president in 2008. She previously served as first lady when her husband, Bill Clinton, served two terms as president. She was born in Chicago in 1947, graduated from Wellesley College and earned a law degree at Yale Law School. She and her husband have one daughter.
","But ultimately, 2,093 emails were given some form of classification, including 22 now marked ""top secret,"" which have been fully withheld from the public. The rest have been redacted. The 22 ""top secret"" emails were part of seven email chains covering 37 pages. They were not classified at the time they were sent. But a few additional emails have also not been released, even though they were not considered classified. Nineteen were exchanges between Clinton and President Barack Obama that covered eight different chains. They were withheld under the law governing the release of presidential documents, designed to encourage candid exchanges of opinion between the president and his staff. There was also one email withheld at the request of an unspecified law enforcement agency. As for the correspondence that Clinton considered to be personal and private, it’s unclear if any of those emails have been recovered. Bloomberg reported in September that the FBI had obtained the server from a company called Platte River Networks in Colorado and had recovered those deleted emails. McClatchy reported in October that some emails were synched with a cloud storage system run by Datto Inc. of Connecticut and Clinton agreed to have that data released to the FBI. However, McClatchy reported ""conflicting accounts as to whether the developments could lead to retrieval of any of Clinton’s more than 31,000 personal emails, which she said she deleted from her private server upon turning over her work-related emails to the State Department, at its request, in December 2014."" That’s a fairly critical point, as congressional Republicans have questioned whether any of those ""personal"" emails contained government business. State Department spokeswoman Lauren Hickey said the released documents only included the work-related emails that Clinton turned over. Any additional material that might have been recovered by the FBI have not been released. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I have now put out all of my emails."" In reality, only about half of the emails sent or received by Clinton on her private email server have been released. Clinton’s comments focus on emails that she and her staff deemed work-related. Clinton says the half that aren’t available are personal and private. The problem is, it was Clinton and her staff who made that determination. Those emails -- more than 30,000 -- haven’t been available for public review, and it’s not entirely clear they can be retrieved. Clinton said, ""I have now put out all of my emails.""

Jim Webb,"""We did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913.""","Jim Webb is running for president of the United States in 2016.
Webb, a Democrat, served as a U.S. senator from Virginia in 2007-13. He served as the first Assistant Secreatry of Defense for Reserve Affairs and Secretary of the Navy in the Ronald Reagan administration.
Webb is a 1968 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and served as a Marine Corps infantry officer until 1972 and saw action in the Vietnam War, for which he was awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts.
Webb was born in Saint Joseph, Mo. He also has a law degree from Georgetown Law Center, Washington, D.C. He has written fiction and nonfictions books and won an Emmy award for his 1983 PBS coverage of the U.S. Marines in Beirut. He frequently writes opinion columns for many publications.
","Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb says the U.S. needs a leaner, more efficient tax code. The former Virginia senator broadly calls for lowering tax rates in exchange for eliminating ""loopholes and exceptions"" that he says ""have made a mockery out of true economic fairness."" Webb says investment income should be taxed at the same rates as wages. And he would like to see the U.S. shift some of its burden away from income and toward consumption. Big changes? Sure. But Webb says the tax code is not sacrosanct. ""We did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913,"" he wrote on his campaign website. Our radar beeped. Somewhere in the course of our lives, we recalled reading or hearing that the income tax had deeper roots in U.S. history than Webb claimed. So we investigated. In 1913, the year Webb cites, the U.S. began a tax on individual incomes, and a levy on personal earnings has been exacted ever since. That was the birth year of the 1040 tax form that, with many modifications, remains in use today. It came with one page of instructions back then, compared with 104 pages this year. Although the form was new, oldtimers in 1913 might have remembered another era when they paid income tax to Washington. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed a measure enacting an income tax to help pay for the Civil War. It imposed a tax of 3 percent on incomes between $600 and $10,000 and a 5 percent tax on incomes above that level. The levy, which had sunset provisions, expired in 1872. It was not forgotten, however. In 1894, Congress passed a new income tax, but it never went into effect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional the next year because it was a direct tax that was not apportioned on the basis of each state’s population. At that time, for example, if 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, then no more than 5 percent of the total revenue could come from Virginia. That constitutional hurdle was cleared by the 16th Amendment, proposed by President William Howard Taft in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913. It allowed the tax to be levied without any apportionment among states. Congress adopted a 1 percent tax on net personal income of more than $3,000 with a surtax of 6 percent on incomes of more than $500,000. By 1918, with World War I raging, the top income bracket soared to a 77 percent tax rate. We ran Webb’s statement past Joseph Thorndike, the director of the online Tax History Museum -- a nonprofit organization based in Falls Church. Thorndike, also an adjunct professor of tax policy at Northwestern University, said Webb’s historical oversight merits a minor penalty. ""I think it’s fair to treat the Civil War tax as an anomaly,"" he said. Wonder where the U.S. got its revenues prior to the income tax? Before the Civil War, government funds primarily came from custom duties, selling public land and temporary excise taxes, according to the Congressional Research Service report. During the decades after the Civil War, when the income tax lapsed, the IRS says about 90 percent of the country’s revenues came from taxes on liquor, beer, wine and tobacco. Our ruling Webb said ""we did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913."" Webb said ""we did not even have a federal income tax in this country until 1913.""

Brad Rockwell,"Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer.""","Austin lawyer Brad Rockwell, who focuses on environmental matters, is former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance.
 
","Vivid image: Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler going to court to keep a judge from stopping petrochemicals from being dumped beneath Barton Springs. Austin attorney Brad Rockwell recently charged Adler, an eminent-domain lawyer, with doing just that. (Disclosure: Rockwell's daughter, Lilly Rockwell, covers city government for our parent newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. She wasn't involved in this fact check.) ""I met Steve Adler in litigation while he was representing a company who was dismantling the SOS ordinance,"" Rockwell said at a Nov. 12, 2014, press conference held with mayoral candidate Mike Martinez next to the lengthy spring-fed swimming pool. Adler and Martinez vie in a Dec. 16 runoff. At the press conference, Brad Rockwell was referring to the Save Our Springs law approved in 1992 to limit development potentially polluting the pool. Rockwell, former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, continued: ""Adler opposed our efforts to get an injunction to stop this company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" Did Adler battle for a company to dump oil ‘neath the pool? Adler represented Lowe’s It’s public record that Adler represented Lowe’s before an Austin state district judge in 2004 and opposed a temporary injunction, shortly granted, that kept Lowe’s from continuing to build a store in Southwest Travis County. In March 2005, though, the Austin City Council moved to settle the dispute, clearing the way for the Brodie Lane store. Adler and others went before a judge in July 2004 in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups that year intended to stop the Lowe’s project from being built on land in the heart of the Barton Springs recharge zone, described in Statesman news stories at the time as covering a 20-mile stretch of Travis and Hays counties. Rainfall in the zone percolates through soil and creek beds, a November 2003 Statesman news story said, replenishing the segment of the Edwards Aquifer that supplies not only Barton Springs but wells serving 50,000 residents. In question: Whether the plaintiffs were right that the construction was subject to the Save Our Springs ordinance limiting impervious cover to 15 percent or, as Lowe’s maintained, the company was free to put in up to 40 percent impervious cover in keeping with what Travis County permitted. In the July 1, 2004, hearing before Judge Scott Jenkins, Adler advanced reasons the project wasn’t subject to the SOS ordinance. Among his contentions: The land wasn’t in Austin’s purview, or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or if it was, the project still could proceed under looser development rules in place when plans were initially submitted to Sunset Valley. Engineer’s testimony And according to a hearing transcript, Adler didn’t say a word about whether Lowe’s should be allowed to pour petrochemicals into the earth. But during the hearing, parties seeking the injunction, including the city of Sunset Valley and Save Our Springs, called to the stand Lauren Ross, an environmental engineer, who testified about her visits to the construction site the day before. Asked if she observed conditions that would drive up average annual pollutants on the site after completion, Ross testified: ""There are clearly pollutants present on the site and discharging from the site that would not have been present prior to the beginning of the construction process."" Specifically, Ross said, she saw ""clear evidence of hydrocarbon sheens on the water in the construction rock"" around a fuel tank in violation of state requirements. Also, Ross testified, there’s ""no containment to prevent fuel spills from moving across the site."" She said that when she visited in the morning, a mesh silt fence intended to keep sediment from flowing off the site was breached at a spot where it looked to her like the land was graded to make all runoff head that way; she said the fence was restored by the time she returned in the afternoon. Most disturbing, Ross said, she saw that water running off the site wasn’t going into a culvert along Brodie Lane. Instead, she said, the flow was going into a hole in the ground onto limestone rock beneath, meaning all the project’s runoff was ""being discharged directly onto limestone that is presumably a recharge feature"" for the aquifer, she said. Asked what the flowing water looked like, Ross said the water had been filtered through the silt fence, but still had sediment and ""any of those escaping hydrocarbon sheens that we know are on the site at a more distant location."" Ross, asked her opinion of the environmental effect of the construction and on surrounding water features of the Lowe’s project, said: ""There is significant risk. And I think what I saw yesterday indicates it is much more than just a risk of contamination of downstream waters and the Edwards Aquifer from the proposed construction. It is clear that despite the engineering standards for erosion-type construction irrigation controls, these systems fail."" She also said she couldn’t recall seeing before the level of hydrocarbon sheens on a construction site that she saw on the Lowe’s site. Earlier in the hearing, Adler told the judge that stopping the $19 million project, which he called ""well underway,"" was ""going to cause greater environmental damage and greater harm than allowing the project to continue."" His legal contentions extended to mention of a 2003 state law intended to make the site subject only to Travis County’s development rules. Judge mentions ‘hydrocarbon spills’ Jenkins’ temporary injunction, issued July 2, 2004, said that if the construction continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury due to degradation of waters in nearby Williamson Creek, Barton Springs, the Edwards Aquifer and Sunset Valley water wells. The court further finds, Jenkins wrote, ""an increased risk of water pollution, were construction allowed to continue in violation of the SOS Ordinance, because of the failure risks inherent in man-made pollution-control features."" Also, Jenkins directed Lowe’s to ""ensure storm water runoff from the property be diverted from flowing into aquifer recharge features at or adjoining the property, that Lowe’s remove fuel tanks from the property, that Lowe’s remove from the property water contaminated by hydrocarbons and perform reasonable remediation of any hydrocarbon spills at the property."" In an interview, Rockwell stressed the judge’s order as an indication his statement was accurate as well as comments by Ross to the Austin Bulldog for a May 21, 2014, news story quoting her saying that what she saw the day before the hearing was ""totally my worst nightmare about why we need to minimize construction over the aquifer. The fuel storage tank failed, secondary containment around the tank failed. ... The silt fence was down, and there was direct migration into the Edwards Aquifer,"" Ross said. Adler calls claim 'outrageous' Adler called the dumping characterization outrageous. ""To dump petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer would be illegal in addition to being immoral,"" Adler said in an interview. ""Neither I nor Lowe’s nor co-counsel ever argued that the company should be able to dump petrochemicals into the aquifer."" The vital issue in court, Adler said, was whether a 4-3 vote by the Austin City Council in December 2003 was sufficient to let the development proceed. Save Our Springs and others successfully maintained in courts through 2004 that in keeping with the SOS ordinance, six council votes should have been required for the project to launch. Adler told us: ""Lowe’s doesn’t want to be dumping hydrocarbons down. No one in the courtroom would countenance dumping hydrocarbons down the aquifer."" Adler noted, too, that concerns about hydrocarbons going into the ground from the site weren’t part of pre-hearing briefs. Rockwell agreed, albeit pointing out no one knew of the oily sheen until the inspection visit by Ross. Rockwell, asked if his statement was an exaggeration, replied not. He also said that what he said at the press conference didn’t ""purport to summarize the whole litigation or everything about what the injunction fight was about. It’s one aspect, one very important aspect."" Other lawyers in the dispute To our inquiries, other lawyers in the dispute offered conflicting takes on this claim. Doug Young, the city attorney for Sunset Valley, which sided with the environmental groups in court, said by phone: ""Was Steve trying to vindicate the right of his client, Lowe’s, to dump petrochemicals down a recharge hole into the aquifer? No, I don’t think he was. But did he hear the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Ross that there were petrochemicals in the surface water there?"" Young added: ""It would be unreasonable to assume Lowe’s intended to dump that gas on the ground and either not worry about where it went or intend for it to go down this recharge feature. There’s no reason to believe that. But it happened. And they opposed"" the injunction to stop the construction. Daniel Byrne, who like Adler represented Lowe’s in the hearing, said by phone: ""The notion that anyone was pumping petrochemicals into the aquifer is complete garbage."" We emailed North Carolina-based Lowe’s about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a ""company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."" It’s not that simple. Adler, representing Lowe’s in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowe’s from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judge’s order in response said Lowe’s should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasn’t rooted in letting Lowe’s dump -- or stopping Lowe’s from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance.

Greg Abbott,"A 2011 measure passed into law with Wendy Davis’ support ""removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like"" the school funding case.","Greg Abbott won election as governor of Texas in November 2014, carrying 59 percent of the vote. Abbott was re-elected in 2018. Abbott, a former member of the Texas Supreme Court, served three terms as the state's attorney general before being succeeded by Ken Paxton in early 2015.","Given an opportunity, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis pressed Republican Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, about his office continuing to battle school districts in court despite a state district judge ruling the school finance system to be both underfunded and unconstitutional. ""The only thing right now coming between our children and appropriate funding of their schools today is you,"" Davis asserted in the pair's Sept. 19, 2014, debate in the Rio Grande Valley. ""On behalf of the 5 million children of this state, will you agree tonight that you will drop your appeals and allow our schools to be appropriately funded?"" Abbott responded by blaming legislators, including Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, for limiting his options. ""Sen. Davis,"" Abbott replied, ""there is actually another thing coming between me and settling that lawsuit. And that is a law that you voted on and helped pass in 2011 that removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like this."" Did legislators including Davis move to keep the attorney general from settling lawsuits? We started this fact check by asking the Abbott campaign for elaboration. Spokeswoman Amelia Chasse pointed to a proposal that won legislative approval in 2011, with Davis among supporters. Then again, it came clear, the legislative leash on the attorney general’s ability to settle cases originated in 2007 action -- more than a year before Davis won her first Senate term. The 2007 law said the attorney general must get legislative approval/consent to settle matters with damages costing the state more than $25 million. The 2011 change lowered the threshold to $10 million. Resolving the school-finance matter would surely cost more than either limit. In 2013 and again in August 2014, state District Judge John Dietz of Austin ruled against the state in the case, though he also gave lawmakers until July 2015 to act. At the time of the Davis-Abbott debate, state lawyers overseen by Abbott were expected to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court (which they did a few days later). By email, David Thompson, a lawyer representing hundreds of districts in the litigation, told us either settlement threshold -- $10 million or the previous $25 million -- ""would be substantially below what it will take to resolve the school finance lawsuit."" Meantime, former state Sen. Steve Ogden, who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and authored the settlement thresholds that passed into law, told us by phone that Abbott can’t settle the school case without the Legislature’s permission ""because it’s going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to do it."" He and Rep. Tryon Lewis, R-Odessa, chairman of the House Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committee, were guided to us by Chasse. Both said the 2011 action effectively toughened and arguably reaffirmed the original restriction. Here are the details behind the legislation leashing the attorney general’s power: In 2007, according to legislative records, Ogden, R-Bryan, won passage of Senate Bill 2031,which required legislative consent or approval of the settlement or compromise of a claim or action against the state involving state expenditures exceeding $25 million. Specifically, the law barred the attorney general or any lawyer representing the state from entering into a settlement of a claim without legislative consent or approval. The new law said this limit applies if the settlement requires the state to pay damages exceeding the $25 million in a biennium or if it ""commits this state to a course of action that in reasonable probability will entail a continuing increased expenditure of state funds over subsequent"" two-year periods, which strikes us as sweeping in a possible resolution of the school suit. In May 2007, very few legislators objected to Ogden’s proposal as it headed toward Gov. Rick Perry. A  House Democrat voted ""no"" in that body’s final vote and three Democratic senators cast ""no"" votes when the Senate later agreed to House amendments. Four years later, with Davis in the Senate, lawmakers and Perry signed off on Senate Bill 899, reducing the dollar threshold for legislative involvement. An accompanying analysis, by the in-house Senate Research Center, said: ""In keeping with increased scrutiny of state expenditures, this bill would lower the threshold settlement amount requiring legislative approval from $25 million to $10 million."" Senators including Davis unanimously advanced the reduction to the House, where it won approval with one Republican voting ""no."" To recap: Davis was not in the Legislature when lawmakers initially limited the attorney general’s ability to settle cases. She was a member of the Senate that approved a toughening. We asked Abbott’s office to explain how, day to day, the limit has been applied to cases. A spokesman, Jerry Strickland, replied after we initially published this fact check, saying by email: ""Procedurally, when a settlement may implicate the statute, the opposing party is notified that any settlement reached will be subject to legislative approval. The terms of the settlement are negotiated before the settlement is brought to the Legislature. The Legislature can then approve, reject or request modifications to a settlement.""  We also asked about the attorney general’s biennial reports to lawmakers on such settlements; such reports were required by the 2007 law. Each biennium, Strickland said, the agency ""provides privileged attorney-client communications concerning potential settlements requiring legislative approval. If a settlement is reached, the settlement is presented to the Legislature for consideration."" Our ruling Abbott said Davis voted for a 2011 measure that removes the attorney general’s ability to settle lawsuits like the school funding case. That’s not so; a 2007 law created the legislative hurdle for major settlements -- and, significantly, Davis wasn’t a senator then. Still, this claim has an element of truth because Davis joined nearly every other lawmaker in tightening the limit in 2011 by reducing the threshold for settlements the attorney general may reach without legislative sign-off to those costing the state $10 million or less.

Jay Wiley,"Austin has ""over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries.""","Jay Wiley was a 2014 candidate for the the District 6 seat on the Austin City Council.
","Rich rich rich! City of Austin employees strike it rich! Sorry. We got carried away by a claim at a forum for Austin City Council candidates thrown by the League of Women Voters and the City of Austin.

Wiley, running in District 6 in Northwest Austin, also said at the forum: ""We’ve got, actually, over 1,000 city employees that make six-figure salaries."" Does that add up? We failed to reach Wiley to learn the origin of his figure. Meantime, city spokeswoman Melissa Alvarado emailed a chart indicating that as of Sept. 1, 2014, 879 workers earned from $100,089 to $304,657. To follow-up queries, Alvarado sent a chart listing 24 vacancies at that time for positions paying $100,000 or more. So, you could say the city had 903 positions paying six figures at the time Wiley spoke. Alvarado said the city then had 11,852 workers, which means its $100,000-plus earners accounted for 7 percent of its workers. Plus, more workers were heading into the six-figure class shortly. To our inquiry, Alvarado said 3.5 percent raises taking effect Sept. 21, 2014, (before the start of the new fiscal year in October) would result in 1,162 employees earning $100,000 or more. At that time, she said, the city expected there to be another 36 open positions paying more than $100,000 each. So at that time, the city projects, 1,198 positions will pay six figures.

Texas Right to Life,"In Texas, ""a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious.""","A statewide anti-abortion and anti-euthanasia group that celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2013, Texas Right to Life says it fights ""for the rights of the unborn (including the nascent humans created in laboratories), the disabled, the sick, the elderly, and the unloved,"" on its website, which also states, ""We are non-sectarian and non-partisan, and we are the Texas affiliate of the National Right to Life Committee with representation on their board of directors.""
","An ad targeting a Republican state senator opened with what sounded like a heartbeat and a wailing siren in the background as the narrator read words displayed on screen: ""If your loved one is in the hospital, you may be shocked to learn that a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious."" A moment later, the narrator said: ""This actually happens to families across Texas."" Death panels, Texas style? Group cites 1999 law In 2013, state Sen. Bob Deuell, a Greenville physician, unsuccessfully proposed changes in a 1999 law that had created a process for situations when there is no advance directive from a patient regarding an end-of-life decision and there’s disagreement between the primary physician and a patient's family over continuing treatment. Texas Right to Life, which describes itself as the state’s oldest ""pro-life"" group, opposed Deuell’s proposal and also created the ad, which it publicized in a press release. Deuell ultimately lost his 2014 runoff for the GOP nomination to challenger Bob Hall. Asked the basis of the ad claim, spokeswoman Melissa Conway emailed a statement from John Seago, Texas Right to Life’s legislative director, referring to Section 166.046 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, which states that a hospital review committee may align with a primary physician on cutting off or continuing a patient’s life-sustaining care. If a panel agrees on ending such care, the patient or person responsible for their care has 10 days to acquire another physician or move to another facility before the hospital is no longer obligated to provide care, the law says, though a court shall extend the 10-day period if it finds a reasonable expectation a physician or facility that will honor the patient's desires will be found with the added time. The law defines ""life-sustaining"" treatment as treatment that, based on reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient without which the patient will die. ""The term includes both life-sustaining medications and artificial life support, such as mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and artificial nutrition and hydration,"" the law says. By email, Seago pointed out the law is silent on who should serve on a review committee nor, he wrote, does it require participants to be identified to the affected family. Seago also said Texas Right to Life, which has advocated for patients, has attended review meetings in which not all committee members were revealed. Seago urged us to reach out to lawyers including Jerri Lynn Ward of Lakeway, near Austin, who said by email that none of her clients--among them, Andrea Clark, whose 2006 dying drew news coverage--knew the names of committee members before review proceedings began. ""I would call that being faceless,"" Ward said. Other views To our inquiries, others including lawyers, physicians and advocacy groups for hospitals and doctors told us the ad claim misrepresents how the Texas law has been carried out. The Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems, said the claim misrepresents elements of such extremely rare hospital committee reviews. By telephone, Carrie Kroll agreed that ""at the end of the day, the hospital can say no, we’re not going to provide care."" But review panels aren’t faceless, Kroll said, in that individuals on the panels meet with the families or guardians challenging a physician’s judgment. Also, Kroll said, most hospitals provide patient ""liaisons"" to guide families and loved ones through the reviews. The Senate-approved version of Deuell’s failed 2013 proposal mandated such liaisons during reviews, according to a Texas Medical Association summary emailed to us by association spokesman Steve Levine. On another front, Kroll said, ""we’re not talking about life-saving care. In most of these instances, it’s a situation where the person is dying. They are not going to walk out of that hospital even if they are conscious. They’re in the end of their life--maybe minutes, days, hours… But they’re not somebody who has gone in for a knee replacement and the hospital is just tired of dealing with them and is going to kill them, as an example,"" Kroll said. Hospital association spokesman Lance Lunsford, asked how often review panels must resolve such disputes, emailed us a summary of a 2012 association survey of 212 hospitals and hospital systems. In 2011, according to the summary, the review process was initiated 21 times at 16 hospitals or systems. The group’s survey for 2010 identified a single review that year, the summary says, and its survey for 2009 indicated the process was initiated twice in two systems. Kroll put us in touch with Jeanine Graf, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, who told us she has served on that hospital’s bioethics committee for at least 15 years. Once a year or every other year, Graf said by phone, the committee decides a child’s care should end because more care would be futile. Otherwise, Graf said, ""we’re just prolonging their deaths."" ""It’s not a faceless committee,"" Graf said. ""The family comes to the committee,"" which consists of nurses, physicians, religious officials and an ethicist, ""and pleads their case. There’s no anonymity. We identify ourselves."" Also, Graf said, she has never seen a patient in such circumstances who was aware of their surroundings. ""They are often the sickest patients who are expected to die no matter what we do,"" she said. After a panel decides more care is unwarranted, usually after a meeting that runs several hours, the family is given at least 10 business days to act, Graf said. ""It very rarely comes to that 10-day clock,"" Graf said. ""The person may die in the interim."" For the medical association, Levine similarly challenged the description of the review committees as ""faceless"" and said the ""rarely used dispute resolution process is used only for terminally or irreversibly ill patients."" Levine suggested we consult attorney Thomas Mayo, an associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University. By email, Mayo told us that since 1998, he’s been part of a statewide working group that regularly discusses the relevant law. By telephone, Mayo suggested the law is more complex than the ad indicates. ""Is it possible a conscious person could be denied life-sustaining treatment because of the actions of a committee? I guess… in the sense the ethics committee has to be consulted and if it is consulted and agrees with the (primary) doctor, then this doctor after a period of time is not obligated to provide that treatment."" Mayo later emailed, calling the statement ""mostly wrong. There is no ‘faceless hospital panel,’ ... and consciousness isn’t the issue. Although the statute doesn’t specify that"" the ""patient should be diagnosed with a terminal or"" an ""irreversible condition in order for this law to apply, that does appear to be the case as a matter of medical practice within the applicable standard of care."" Mayo urged us to contact Robert L. Fine, a Dallas palliative-care physician who told us he’s advised legislators about the law on behalf of his employer, the Baylor Health Care System, and the state medical and hospital associations. By email, Fine expressed skepticism about any physician or review committee employing the law to judge the condition of anyone not terminally or irreversibly ill. ""I don’t know of a single hospital ethics committee that would let that happen,"" Fine said. Affected patients are ""not going to be cured,"" Fine said. ""When these cases come up… it’s always when a patient is  terminal or irreversibly ill; typically"" when they’re suffering; often when there is ""division within the family""; and only when an attending physician says further treatment is inappropriate, Fine said, often because the nursing staff is urging that decision. Fine also said: ""I can’t promise you there’s not some rogue hospital or committee out there. But the question would be why isn’t the family taking that"" result ""public?"" Group stands by claim Next, we ran what the medical community was telling us past Seago, who replied by email that nothing  disproved what the law allows to occur, including the ""faceless"" panels. Seago pointed out, too, the law doesn’t limit review panels to considering cases involving terminally ill patients. ""Our ad was about the law and instead of looking at the law you are trusting the testimony of doctors,"" Seago emailed. Our ruling Texas Right to Life said in Texas, ""a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious."" This claim accurately tracks a portion of the law and we see how one could construe this scenario. The law doesn't specify how hospital review panels should be composed or run. But doctors and hospitals insist the law has been carried out in ways not acknowledged here. For starters, the rarely convened review panels aren’t faceless; committee members are reportedly introduced at the reviews. Also, consciousness is not an element of  the law. Finally, the law permits courts to add to the 10 days provided for families to find an alternate facility, which the ad doesn’t mention.

John Kerry,"""In the last couple of days, notices were sent (by officials in Ukraine) to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews.""","John Kerry is the secretary of state. He previously was a senator from Massachusetts and the Democratic Party's nominee for president in 2004.
","Secretary of State John Kerry spoke from Geneva on Thursday with appalling news about religious intolerance in the Ukrainian-Russian crisis. ""In the last couple of days, notices were sent to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews,"" Kerry said. ""In the year 2014, after all of the miles traveled and all of the journey of history, this is not just intolerable; it's grotesque."" On Facebook and Twitter, the public feared the history of the Holocaust was repeating itself. At PolitiFact, we’re used to finding inconsistencies in media coverage of Ukraine, so we wanted to take a closer look at the situation. We found that Ukrainian Jews are not being forced to register. The story seems to have originated in Donetsk, a region and a city in eastern Ukraine. On April 7, pro-Russian activists took control of Donetsk’s government building. Almost two weeks later, USA Today reported, ""Leaflet tells Jews to register in East Ukraine."" Citing an Israeli news article, USA Today reported that Jews emerging from a synagogue in Donetsk on April 14 were handed pamphlets asking them to ""register"" with pro-Russian militants. If Jewish adults refused to register and pay a $50 fee, they’d be forced out of the country. On the same day the story appeared, Kerry mentioned the notice in his speech. We reached out to Kerry's office for evidence, but they pointed us back to his remarks. Almost immediately, there were signs that the fliers weren’t really coming from any kind of authority. The separatist whose signature allegedly appears on the flier -- Donetsk People’s Republic Chairman Denis Pushilin, leader of the pro-Russian militants -- denied any connection to it. Reporters on the ground quickly found that no one was actually being registered. PolitiFact exchanged emails with Ari Shapiro, an NPR international correspondent reporting from Donetsk, who said there is a real flier, but it went ignored until the media caught on. Shapiro himself went after the story and shared his reporting with us. ""You walk down the street with a beard and kippah,"" said Yaguda Kellerman, deputy chief of the Donetsk Jewish Community Center, to Shapiro. ""And you never experience any problems here. I was born in Donetsk."" Donetsk chief rabbi Pinchas Vishedski acknowledged the flier’s existence, but called it a provocation, Shapiro reported. U.S. media outlets like Vox and the New Republic have also questioned its validity. A New York Times report from Donetsk said that militants never intended to set up a registry, and the room designated for registering Jews sat empty Thursday. Both sides -- pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian -- have accused each other of anti-Semitism during this conflict. An April 15 United Nations report noted that the Association of Jewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine has said incidents are isolated and that Jewish people, generally speaking, don’t feel threatened by Ukrainian leaders. The pro-Russia rebels have since put out their own flier attacking the original anti-Semitism accusations, Shapiro reported. Our ruling Kerry said Ukrainian Jews are being asked to register. There was a flier, but it doesn’t seem to have been issued by any authority. No one knows yet who distributed them, but the separatist movement denies issuing the fliers. Jewish community leaders in the area have denounced the pamphlets’ legitimacy. Reporters on the ground in Donetsk say that the fliers aren’t being taken seriously, and no Jews are registering.

Kasim Reed,"""State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay it a certain amount above appraisal.""
 ","
Kasim Reed is Mayor of Atlanta.
","The mayor said the state, specifically the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which is in charge of negotiations with the church, can only offer a certain amount of money. Reed explained during an Aug. 7 interview with Sports Radio 680 The Fan. ""The state has some limitations on what they can pay above the appraised price. ... We’re not going to be able to pay Mount Vernon $19.5 million because of the constraints that the state has in what they can pay,"" Reed said on the station’s program ""The Front Row."" The mayor went into more detail about a minute later. ""State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay a certain amount above appraisal,"" Reed said. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the mayor is correct. Is the state limited on how far it can move the financial goal posts to strike a deal with the church? The Atlanta Falcons have been working with the city, the GWCCA and others on a deal to build a new stadium, replacing the Georgia Dome, which is owned by the state. The city would prefer to build the new stadium on land south of the Dome, in large part because of its accessibility to MARTA rail lines. In order to build on that site, the city would need land where two longtime churches stand, Friendship Baptist Church and Mount Vernon. The initial deadline to work out a deal with the churches was Aug. 1. Although the city struck a deal with Friendship, the GWCCA was unable to do so with Mount Vernon. Reed held a news conference Aug. 6 asking all involved to continue the discussions. The $6.2 million value is included in a two-page revised appraisal letter completed July 30 for the state. The letter provides an ""as-is"" value for the church. The letter lists the value for the church at $30 per square foot, or roughly $3.4 million for 113,000 square feet. An additional $2.8 million is included for parking revenue. Reed’s communications director, Sonji Jacobs, referred to language in the Georgia Constitution, known as the Gratuities Clause, to explain the mayor’s point. State Properties Commission spokeswoman Cindy Presto referenced the same language in the constitution -- Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VI(a) -- when we contacted the agency seeking help. It reads: ""Except as otherwise provided in the Constitution, (1) the General Assembly shall not have the power to grant any donation or gratuity or to forgive any debt or obligation owing to the public, and (2) the General Assembly shall not grant or authorize extra compensation to any public officer, agent, or contractor after the service has been rendered or the contract entered into."" Said Jacobs: ""Basically, if the state does not pay appraised value, it could be thought to be providing an unearned benefit, which is not allowed under Georgia law."" Olens said in an email to PolitiFact that his office has for decades interpreted the Gratuities Clause in the state constitution as limiting the state to ""paying fair market value for property, absent some additional source of value that the state receives from the transaction."" The Attorney General’s Office believes there’s no gray area concerning state guidelines on appraisals, said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for Olens. ""It’s a black and white issue,"" she said. Kane said the appraisal value, absent a special circumstance, is considered the fair-market value that can be paid for a property. The proposed $1 billion stadium, she said, is not considered a special circumstance. When there is a dispute in appraisals, the state agency in some cases may accept the higher appraisal, Kane said. ""But as a general matter, the highest appraisal is the limit of what an agency may pay absent special circumstances,"" she said. ""No such dispute exists here, and there are no special circumstances."" The Attorney General’s Office has been involved in the negotiations with Mount Vernon. Kane said her office is unaware of any instances in which the state Supreme Court ruled contrary to attorney general opinions concerning the Gratuities Clause. The attorney general is the top attorney for state agencies, Olens said. He said the GWCCA must abide by attorney general rulings like this one. Olens is correct if a state agency is buying the property, Emory University law professor Frank Alexander said. ""An attorney general’s opinion under Georgia law is the opinion of the attorney general. It is usually seen to be binding for the AG’s clients, which are the state agencies,"" Alexander said. GWCCA spokeswoman Jennifer LeMaster said the sole purchaser of the Mount Vernon property would be the state, or the GWCCA as the state agency involved in the negotiations. On the purchase price guidelines, the agency defers to the attorney general, she said. Reed has worked independently to reach a deal with the church, announcing recently that Mount Vernon would agree to $15.5 million. But any amount over the $6.2 million would have to come from another party, likely in the form of a gift, LeMaster said.

Mitch McConnell,"Says Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told insurance companies ""they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them.""",Mitch McConnell is a U.S. Senator from Kentucky and the Republican minority leader in the U.S. Senate.,"
Sen. Mitch McConnell says the Obama administration has created a ""culture of intimidation"" in Washington. 
One example: Obamacare. 
""Over at HHS back during the Obamacare debate, Secretary (Kathleen) Sebelius sent out a directive to help insurance companies telling them they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them."" McConnell, R-Ky., said on Meet the Press on May 19, 2013. 
A McConnell spokesman pointed us to a 2009 letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, often known as CMS, to Humana. The agency wrote the letter to respond to mailings that Humana sent to its nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage and Part D patients. In bold type, Humana told its enrollees that ""millions of seniors and disabled individuals could lose many of the important benefits and services that make Medicare Advantage health plans so valuable."" 
In the letter, CMS told two Humana executives that CMS was concerned that ""this information is misleading and confusing to beneficiaries, represents information to beneficiaries as official communications about the Medicare Advantage program, and is potentially contrary to federal regulations and guidance."" 
The letter was relatively narrow in scope: It dealt with Humana, as a government contractor, and the information it was giving Medicare beneficiaries. 
It provides little support for McConnell’s claim because it said nothing about private insurance companies communicating with policyholders. 
It’s worth noting, too, that the Obama administration later clarified its rules saying Medicare Advantage contractors could communicate with Medicare beneficiaries about pending legislation as long as they did not use federal money to do so and they got permission from beneficiaries before sending them information about legislation or asking them to join advocacy efforts. 
Then another letter came to our attention. 
The AHIP letter 
Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, wrote to America’s Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, on Sept. 9, 2010, a few months after Obamacare became law. 
In the letter, Sebelius accused insurance companies of spreading misinformation by saying Obamacare was to blame for expected premium increases. 
""Given the importance of the new protections and the facts about their impact on costs, I ask for your help in stopping misinformation and scare tactics about the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, I want AHIP’s members to be put on notice: the Administration, in partnership with states, will not tolerate unjustified rate hikes in the name of consumer protections,"" Sebelius wrote. 
She said insurers would be required to justify any rate increases, that there would be state and federal reviews of increases that don’t appear justified, and insurers that have a record of unjustified increases would be excluded from the insurance exchanges set up by the law. 
Sebelius also disputed the insurance companies’ predictions that Obamacare would necessitate higher premiums and said any cost increases would be offset by savings built into the law. 
When the letter came out in 2010, Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the libertarian CATO Institute, said Sebelius' letter was an attempt to ""intimidate those who say unflattering things about ObamaCare."" 
""What business does she have threatening insurers because they disagree with her in public?  ObamaCare gave the HHS secretary considerable new powers. Is one of those the power to regulate what insurers say about ObamaCare? Excluding insurers from ObamaCare’s exchanges is not a minor threat,"" Cannon wrote. 
An HHS spokesman told PolitiFact that the letter was in response to insurance companies using Obamacare as an excuse to raise premiums, and that the law gave the agency the authority to scrutinize excessive premium increases and require justifications from insurance companies. 
But we find Cannon's interpretation more accurate. The letter chastised the insurers for anti-Obamacare messages and threatened them with regulatory action. 
Our ruling 
McConnell said that Sebelius told insurance companies ""they couldn't inform their policyholders of what they thought the impact of Obamacare would be on them."" 
Her letter to AHIP didn’t go quite that far, but Sebelius was definitely seeking to muzzle the insurers because she felt they were giving false, self-serving information. The letter sought to discourage them with a not-so-subtle threat of regulatory action. Although McConnell was exaggerating that the companies were prohibited from these communications, the talk of regulatory action was significant and could fairly be taken as an attempt to intimidate.

Sarah Eckhardt,Says Travis County's unemployment rate is below the national average while its poverty rate exceeds the national average--and local poverty is rising.,"Sarah Eckhardt, a lawyer, is a former assistant county attorney. She initially won election to the Travis County Commissioners Court in 2006 and in 2014 won election as the Travis County judge.
","
A Travis County commissioner who may bid in 2014 to succeed Sam Biscoe as county judge suggests conditions are tough locally despite ""present prosperity.""

In a Feb. 18, 2013, email blast, Sarah Eckhardt called for reversing ""our rising poverty,"" after writing: ""Our unemployment rate is below the national average, yet our poverty rate exceeds the national average.""

That’s a three-part claim: Is unemployment below the rest of the nation? Does the county’s poverty rate exceed the national rate--and is local poverty rising?

Unemployment

Eckhardt, a Democrat, told us by email that Travis County’s December 2012 unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, meaning that was the share of adults who did not have a job, had actively looked for work in the prior four weeks and were available for work. That was less than the Texas rate of 6.1 percent, Eckhardt said, and the U.S. rate of 7.8 percent.

Those state and national rates, she cautioned, were adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations such as changes in weather, harvests, major holidays and school schedules. The county’s rate was not adjusted, Eckhardt noted.

By email, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist advised against comparing seasonally adjusted and unadjusted unemployment rates. Cheryl Abbot also said that the unadjusted December 2012 national unemployment rate was 7.6 percent when the Travis County rate was 4.9 percent.

At our request, Abbot provided a chart showing Travis County’s unemployment rate and the national rate from 2009 through 2012. The county unadjusted unemployment rate consistently was less than the national rate, the chart shows. The county experienced its highest rate, 7.3 percent, in January 2010, the same month the national rate topped out at 10.6 percent.

So, the county’s jobless rate has been lower than the national  one.

 Poverty

In 2011, Eckhardt said, Travis County and Texas had identical 18 percent poverty rates, according to the 2011 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, while the national poverty rate was 16 percent.

As noted in a Dec. 16, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, poverty rates can vary by subgroups. That story says that according to 2011 bureau surveys, 23 percent of Travis County’s school-age children lived in poverty. The story says the 2011 child poverty rate ranged in neighboring counties from 10 percent in Williamson County to 21 percent in Bastrop County. Nationally, 21 percent of children lived in poverty that year, the story says.

Eckhardt provided a chart, which she described as coming from a county presentation drawing on the bureau’s surveys, indicating the county’s poverty rate was as low as 12.5 percent in 2000, but escalated to 15.7 percent in 2005 before dipping to 14.7 percent in 2007 and then increasing for three years to 19.2 percent in 2010. 
We did not find that report. But the county’s December 2012 ""Travis County Snapshot"" report, drawing on the census surveys, says 192,436 county residents lived in poverty in 2011, down from 194,156 residents in poverty in 2010, but more than the 163,690 impoverished residents in 2009.

Next, with help from bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, we confirmed that the county had a greater share of low-income residents than the nation in 2011 when the federal poverty level for a family of four was about $23,000.

For a longer view, we checked annual poverty rates for the county, Texas and the nation from 2000 through 2011 based on the bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, which combine data from administrative records, results from the once-a-decade census and more recent population estimates and the bureau’s household surveys to ""provide consistent and reliable single-year estimates,"" the agency says. 
Estimated Poverty Rates (Percentage of Population) 
Source: Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Feb. 20, 2013) 
The county’s poverty rate was around the same as or less than the national rate from 2000 through 2002, but the county rate exceeded the national rate starting in 2003 when the county rate was 13.9 percent and the national rate was 12.5 percent, according to the estimates.

The county’s rate went up and down over the 11 years, escalating from 9.9 percent in 2000 to 15.5 percent in 2005, then dropping three straight years to 14.4 percent in 2009 before increasing to 18.8 percent in 2010--before dipping to 18.1 percent in 2011, when the national rate was 15.9 percent.

So, the county poverty rate exceeds the national rate, though the county rate decreased from 2010 to 2011, the year of the latest available rate. 
After we posted this fact check, a Texas expert objected, saying that the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates were too close for anyone to conclude poverty went down between years. Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst with the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, also said the drop in the raw estimated number of residents in poverty--as shown in the county’s snapshot report on the 2011 American Community Survey--was likewise too slight to be statistically certain.

By our eyes, the margins of error in the 2011 and 2009-11 survey results mean that about 179,000 to 206,000 residents were in poverty in 2011, compared with 176,000 to 188,000 residents in 2009-11.

Phew.

Castro said that ""when surveys require several years’ worth of data in order to be statistically significant, you can’t isolate year-to-year trends – they all get smoothed out in the averages.  That’s why looking at long-term trends, like over a decade, are more helpful.  They tell you what’s changing (or not changing) in the underlying nature of an area’s economy that really improves or worsens residents’ quality of life.""

Separately, we ran Castro’s point about comparing the county’s estimated 2010 and 2011 poverty rates past the Census Bureau. Wes Basel, chief of its Small Area Estimates Branch, agreed by email that the 2011-2010 difference in the county’s estimated poverty rate is ""not large enough to be statistically significant,"" though he said comparisons of the county’s 2011 estimated rate to estimates for 2005 through 2010 are statistically significant; those estimated rates mostly went up in the intervening years, though there were dips, too.

Eckhardt, standing by her claim, earlier noted the near doubling in the county’s poverty rate since 2000. ""The year-to-year snapshot is not nearly as interesting as the"" longer timeframe, she said.

Our ruling

Eckhardt said the county’s unemployment rate is below the national average, yet its poverty rate exceeds the national average--and local poverty is rising.

The local jobless rate has consistently trailed the national rate and the county’s poverty rate has exceeded the national rate since 2003. 
The county’s poverty rate dipped from 2010 to 2011, though that dip was not statistically significant. Also, the 2011 rate of 18.1 percent was nearly double the rate in 2000, so it looks like poverty has risen over the years. Then again, Eckhardt's statement does not acknowledge that the county rate has oscillated year to year, sometimes going down. It's not been a steady rise.

Facebook posts,"Says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has ""accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history,"" because it's actually risen ""slower than at any time in nearly 60 years.""","Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","UPDATE, May 31, 2012 While we have already shared some of the critiques of this fact-check in a previous follow-up story, critics have since noted that two of our fellow fact checkers -- the Washington Post Fact Checker and the Associated Press -- offered more negative rulings on related claims. The Fact Checker addressed the apparent discrepancy succinctly in a follow-up column, saying ""we did not evaluate the same thing."" Nutting attributed spending from the first year of every presidential term to the previous administration, arguing that every new president starts their term four months into a fiscal year begun under their predecessor. Historically, this has not been a particularly controversial approach, and even some of Nutting’s critics we spoke to agreed that it’s not a bad rule of thumb. But fiscal year 2009 was special because it came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. Nutting did take these factors into account, but not to the extent that some critics think is needed. Nutting shifted $140 billion in fiscal 2009 spending from two of Obama’s signature programs -- the economic stimulus package and an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- out of Bush’s column and into Obama’s. He also shifted excess spending beyond what Bush would have spent from the appropriations bills signed by Obama in 2009. A number of critics also argued that spending for the Troubled Asset Relief Program should be taken into account. This program aided troubled financial institutions and involved a lot of money going out the door in fiscal 2009 and a lot of money coming in the door in subsequent years as the money was paid back to the treasury. The critics note that counting the TARP expenses as Bush’s artificially raises the baseline level of spending Obama inherited, thereby making Obama’s subsequent spending increases seem unrealistically small. We think reasonable people can disagree on which president should be responsible for TARP spending, but to give the critics their say, we’ll include it in our alternative calculation. So, combining the fiscal 2009 costs for programs that are either clearly or arguably Obama’s -- the stimulus, the CHIP expansion, the incremental increase in appropriations over Bush’s level and TARP -- produces a shift from Bush to Obama of between $307 billion and $456 billion, based on the most reasonable estimates we’ve seen critics offer. That’s quite a bit larger than Nutting’s $140 billion, but by our calculations, it would only raise Obama’s average annual spending increase from 1.4 percent to somewhere between 3.4 percent and 4.9 percent. That would place Obama either second from the bottom or third from the bottom out of the 10 presidents we rated, rather than last. When we encounter a compound claim such as this one, we consider the accuracy of each part separately. During our internal discussions, we give a preliminary rating to each half of a claim, then average them to produce our final, published rating.

As for whether 2011 was the best job-producing year since 2005, he’s right if you’re counting private-sector jobs, and slightly off if you’re counting all jobs. 
In 2011, the number of private-sector jobs rose by about 1.83 million (if you count from the January amount to the December amount) or 1.92 million (if you count from December to December). Either way, the increase in 2011 represented the highest one-year total since 2005, when the number of private-sector jobs increased by either 2.22 million or 2.31 million, depending on the time period used. 
If you use total jobs, the increase in 2011 was the biggest since 2006, not 2005. But here too, that’s not the measure Obama used, so we won’t consider it in our rating. 
Finally, there's another dimension. In his remarks, Obama described the damage to the economy, including losing millions of jobs ""before our policies were in full effect."" Then he describes the subsequent job increases. This suggests that he’s taking a degree of credit for the job growth, which runs counter to the reality that no mayor or governor or president deserves all the blame or all the credit for changes in employment.

Instead, a judge would make that decision, just as existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders in cases involving vaginal intercourse on the registry.

Facebook posts,"Says Jacob Blake, shot by police in Kenosha, had a warrant for sexual assault and prior convictions for gun use","Posters on Facebook and other social media networks.
 ","A viral Facebook post says Blake had a warrant for sexual assault and prior convictions for gun use. Blake did have an active warrant for sexual assault and several other crimes related to domestic violence at the time he was shot. But Blake was not convicted of any prior gun offenses. Charges filed in 2015 were ultimately dismissed at the request of prosecutors. When Kenosha police shot a Black man in the back seven times, it launched a now all-too-familiar avalanche of reaction. Protests. Property damage. And an online rush to judgement fueled by each poster’s pre-existing position on social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. Police shot Jacob Blake, 29, on the evening of Aug. 23, 2020, as he attempted to get into a small SUV with his three sons inside while officers aimed guns at him, according to officials and a bystander’s video of the incident that has been shared throughout the world. Blake survived, but his family’s attorney said he is paralyzed from the waist down At this stage, there are more questions than answers about what happened before the video was taken. Some of that may not be known for months, until an outside review by the state Department of Justice is completed. But we can address Blake’s background, which many posters have used to suggest is evidence that he is to blame for what happened. An Aug. 24, 2020, Facebook post shared thousands of times asserts Blake ""had an active warrant for domestic violence and sexual assault"" and ""has prior criminal convictions for illegal gun use."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Such allegations are a common and patently unfair response to tragic events that need to be corrected, said Daniel Medwed, professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University School of Law.  Attacks on a victim’s actions and background can impact both the court of public opinion and the ensuing criminal court actions, he said. ""You’re fighting in two different courts basically with a high-profile case, and victim-blaming can 'help' with both,"" Medwed said. ""The narrative seems to always be about the danger posed by the victim, to basically create a sentiment that police were in danger. … The implication from that is that because there’s something bad about their character they somehow deserved what they got, which is patently absurd and absolutely disgusting."" Here’s what we know about Blake’s past contact with law enforcement. The first part of this claim is largely accurate. Blake was charged July 6, 2020, with felony third-degree sexual assault and misdemeanor trespassing and disorderly conduct. All three offenses carried a penalty enhancer because they were connected to domestic abuse. The charges — which have not gone to trial — stem from a May 3, 2020, incident in Kenosha County. A woman Blake knew told police he came into her house about 6 a.m., sexually assaulted her and then took a debit card and car keys before fleeing in her vehicle, according to a criminal complaint. (Contrary to many social media claims, the woman involved in this case was an adult). A warrant for Blake’s arrest was filed the day after the criminal complaint, online court records show. Police radio traffic shows officers were dispatched for ""family trouble,"" and a dispatcher named Blake as taking the caller’s keys and refusing to give them back. A dispatcher used the police code 10-99 while sending officers, alerting them to Blake's warrant. The second element of the claim is wrong. Blake was charged with a gun-related offense in 2015, but he was not convicted. The Facebook post offered as proof a Sept. 22, 2015, article from the Racine County Eye website. It described charges being filed, but did not reference a conviction. Our review of court records shows a confrontation at a Racine County bar led to a combative traffic stop and a total of five criminal charges in September 2015, including resisting an officer, disorderly conduct and three gun-related ones. But those charges were later dismissed on a motion from prosecutors, said Racine County Clerk of Circuit Court Samuel Christensen. The court file said it was dismissed in February 2018 ""due to witness issues and age of case."" After this fact-check published, the Facebook page that posted the claim edited the post to note the error and correct the reference to a conviction. Since more than two years has passed since the case was dismissed, it is no longer visible via online court records, per a Wisconsin Supreme Court rule.  A viral Facebook post says Blake had a warrant for sexual assault and prior convictions for gun use. Blake did have an active warrant for sexual assault and several other crimes related to domestic violence at the time he was shot. But Blake was not convicted of any prior gun offenses. Charges filed in 2015 were ultimately dismissed at the request of prosecutors.

Michael Bloomberg,"""No other city in America did what (New York) did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%.""","Michael Bloomberg was mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. The billionaire co-founded Bloomberg LP, a financial information and media company, in 1981. On Nov. 24, 2019, he announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president and dropped out on March 4, 2020.","Bloomberg said, ""No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%."" He’s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers. But Bloomberg can’t claim all the credit, in that the declines began before he took office and continued afterward; and experts including the FBI warn against using statistics to make city-to-city comparisons. Now let’s dig into each of the four parts of his current claim. Bloomberg’s campaign cited data showing there were 649 murders in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, and 335 in 2013, his final year in office. That’s a reduction of roughly half. But murders started declining a decade before Bloomberg took office and continued downward after he left.  Murders dropped ""precipitously"" during the 1990s — from roughly 2,200 at the start of the decade, noted Ames Grawert of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. ""Was the slope any steeper during Bloomberg than in the preceding decade? Not at all,"" said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of law and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. In 2013, the total number of shots fired by officers — 248 — and total shooting incidents — 81 — were the lowest since the New York Police Department began keeping such records in 1971, according to the department’s 2013 annual firearms discharge report, which Bloomberg’s campaign cited. Police shot and killed eight people and injured 17 others that year, the report says. But here, too, Bloomberg appears to be going too far by taking credit: The trend downward started before Bloomberg took office. And while shooting incidents hit the record low of 81 in 2013, they had risen to 105 a year earlier, during his tenure. ""The fact that reductions have continued under de Blasio shows that the declines are being driven by factors other than the municipal genius of mayoral-led policing and prosecutorial strategies,"" said Eugene O’Donnell, a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.  In 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, New York City had 703 jailed or imprisoned inmates for every 100,000 residents, according to the mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice. In 2013, it was 429  — a drop of 39%. The same chart shows, however, that the decline began years before Bloomberg took office and has continued for years afterward, the figure was 910 in 1996 before dropping to the 703 in 2001, a decline of 23% in five years. And there’s another issue. ""The criminal prosecution/punishment decisions are not those of the mayor or his administration,"" said Franklin Zimring, a University of California, Berkeley, School of Law faculty director of criminal justice studies and author of the 2012 book, ""The City That Became Safe: New York’s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control."" Bloomberg’s campaign says no other city has achieved the three reductions Bloomberg touted. There is truth to that. ""New York City is in a class by itself in the country on public safety — serious crime has dropped for decades,"" O’Donnell told us. But comparisons are dicey. The FBI is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Among other things, the FBI points out that no two cities are alike and the rates at which crimes are reported vary among cities. Bloomberg said, ""No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%."" He’s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers.

He is from Madison and previously served as a Democratic member of the Wisconsin state Assembly. ","Pocan said Trump’s response to Mueller — that there was ""insufficient evidence"" and therefore Trump is innocent — is ""in direct contradiction"" to what Mueller said. Mueller did use the term ""insufficient evidence,"" but that was in a generic reference to proof of a broad conspiracy involving Russian election interference. Trump’s tweet treats that statement as a commentary on his own guilt or innocence. In actuality, Mueller was very clear that he cannot charge a sitting president with a crime, and therefore out of fairness couldn’t even accuse him of one. And Mueller was careful to note, ""if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" So Mueller made a vague reference to ""insufficient evidence"" of a conspiracy related to Russian interference. Trump’s tweet, meanwhile, implies a much more specific and far-reaching meaning — that there was no evidence Trump himself committed any crime. Mueller said no such thing. In fact, Mueller addressed a potential interpretation like Trump’s in his comments. ""After that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller said. ""We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime."" What’s more, Mueller said his office didn’t assess whether Trump committed a crime — because it could not issue any such charges against a sitting president anyway. ""Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional,"" Mueller said. ""Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. … It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge."" He went on to refer to impeachment as the only way to address such a matter. ""The (Department of Justice) opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" Mueller said. ""Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime."" Ron Boehmer, a spokesman for Pocan, said the congressman’s tweet was referring to this limitation. ""Special Counsel Mueller did not reference insufficient evidence, but rather a restriction on being able to charge the President and made it very clear that he could not be cleared,"" Boehmer said in an email. So, Pocan’s ""direct contradiction"" claim isn’t exactly cut and dried. Trump did use the same term as Mueller. But it’s clear Trump over-reached in his summary of Mueller’s comments, claiming a level of vindication that Mueller didn’t offer. Pocan said Trump’s response to Mueller — that there was ""insufficient evidence"" and therefore Trump is innocent — is ""in direct contradiction"" to what Mueller said.

Two years later, she declined to endorse a bill to require her attorney general’s office to appoint a special prosecutor to examine fatal shootings by the police. She also did not call for this change after a high-profile fatal police shooting in Sacramento in 2018.

","A video by Florida Strong says Gillum ""oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder."" This attack is hollow.

Scott Walker,"Says Tony Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities.""
 
","Scott Walker, a Republican, is the former governor of Wisconsin. He was first elected in November 2010. He survived a recall election in 2012, defeating Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett after igniting controversy with a bill curtailing public-employee union collective-bargaining rights.  He won re-election to a four-year term in November 2014 and was a 2016 presidential candidate before dropping out in September of 2015. He was defeated by Tony Evers in the 2018 gubernatorial election. Walker is a former Milwaukee County executive and former member of the state Assembly.","Walker says Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released. A new, similar Walker attack  — zeroing in on Tony Evers  — has a similar problem. On Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad. The governor’s spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he ""failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools."" Then the narrator asserts that Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Walker’s use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check. That is, a 50 percent reduction ""today"" — rather than say, over a period of years — would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. There are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includes those who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation or extended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury. But Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction. And it’s important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isn’t the only way to cut the prison population in half. On the day Walker’s TV ad was released, Evers reacted by telling reporters: ""That’s a lie. I never said that. We will not release violent criminals. We’re not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker."" (Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.) To back the first part of Walker’s claim — that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walker’s campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate  between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope. Moderator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population  — Evers: Absolutely, and that's a goal that’s worth accomplishing … We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes. The Walker campaign argues that Evers’ response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAH’s website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015. But neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years. And we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame. Evers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison. He has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior. 
Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us it’s possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes — or at least not thousands of them. Streit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations.   Whether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround. But, despite Walker’s claim, it’s also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes. One more point before we close: Ryan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses. Walker says Evers ""wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities."" Evers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that — a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released.

Kamala Harris,"""It costs us about $33,000 a year (on average nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year.""","Kamala Harris is the vice president of the United States. Harris was elected as a senator from California in 2016. She previously was California’s attorney general from 2011 to 2017. From 2004 until 2011, she was the district attorney of San Francisco. Harris received a bachelor’s degree in political science and economics from Howard University and a J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of Law. In 2019, she ran for the Democratic nomination for president and dropped out in December. On Aug. 11, 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden named Harris as his running mate.","Our research A spokesperson for Harris provided us with data on the cost of federal incarceration, from the independent Vera Institute of Justice, as well as numbers for California, based on Gov. Jerry Brown’s spending plan for the 2017-18 fiscal year. In its May 2017 report ""The Price of Prisons,"" the Vera Institute examined the cost to house inmates at prisons nationwide. It obtained data for 45 states and found the total cost per inmate averaged $33,274. The institute advocates for reducing inmate totals and improving conditions in prisons. It reported receiving about three-quarters of its funding from the federal government. The study’s findings support Harris’ claim on the average cost of housing inmates nationally. But what about the California’s per inmate price of $75,000? For that figure, Harris’ spokesman cited a June 2017 article by the Associated Press. It estimated the cost per inmate would reach a record $75,560 in the current fiscal year. The AP based its estimate on the money Gov. Brown set aside in this year’s budget for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. To verify this figure and put it in context, we examined the governor’s 2017-18 budget and contacted the Brown Administration’s corrections and finance departments, as well as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. These sources pointed us to the projected $76,320 cost per inmate in Brown’s 2017-18 budget. That qualifies as ""about $75,000"" as Harris put it. A spokeswoman for the state’s corrections department told us California paid about $73,000 per inmate last fiscal year, also very close to Harris’ number. Cost in context While Harris’ numbers are nearly spot on, we wanted to know what’s driving this high cost to lock up prisoners in California. The expense to house each inmate has doubled since 2005, even as court orders reduced the prison population by about a quarter, according to the Associated Press. Several reasons account for the dramatic increase. Viewed simply, fewer inmates combined with higher corrections spending equals a higher per capita cost. But why are there fewer inmates and higher spending? California was forced to cut inmate levels after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that overcrowding in prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The drop in inmates hasn’t led to the closure of any prisons and hasn’t led to a reduction of prison staffing that corresponds directly to the drop in inmates. Jonathan Peterson, an analyst at the Legislative Analyst’s Office, said that’s because there are security requirements at the prisons that don’t allow for the elimination of guards simply because there are fewer inmates. ""Regardless of how many inmates are in a particular unit, you still need the one guard to open and close the doors,"" Peterson said. The governor’s budget expects a nearly 2-to-1 inmate to prison staff ratio for the current fiscal year. That’s down from a ratio of a 2.24-to-1 just two years ago. Higher employee costs Just as the inmate population started to drop, employee compensation in the prison system jumped significantly. The corrections department budget has gone up $1.2 billion since 2012 due to employee compensation and retirement costs, according to the Department of Finance. Of that increase, $436 million is directly tied to increased pension contributions by the state for prison employees. Additionally, in July 2013, the state opened the California Health Care Facility providing 2,600 beds for inmates needing medical attention. The facility has cost $288 million since it opened, the finance department reported. California voters have contributed to the shrinking prison population in recent years by approving ballot measures that reclassify many felony drug and property crimes as misdemeanors and improving chances for parole for offenders classified as nonviolent. These measures are expected to further reduce the prison population by thousands of inmates. If that happens and prison employee costs rise or stay stable, California’s per capita inmate expense will continue to be higher than other states. Our ruling Sen.

Gwen Moore,"Says Dontre Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee.""","U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore is a Democratic member of Congress, representing Wisconsin's 4th District, which primarily includes Milwaukee. Moore, who served in the state Legislature from 1989 to 2004, was elected to Congress in 2004.","Hamilton, a 31-year-old diagnosed with schizophrenia, had a history of contacts with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. He was shot to death by Christopher Manney, a Milwaukee officer who worked in the downtown area, on April 30, 2014. Manney was fired -- not for the fatal shooting itself, but for the way he approached Hamilton, which led to a scuffle. Here’s a summary of the incident from our Clinton fact check, based on a report by the Milwaukee County district attorney: First call: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee at the Starbucks located in Red Arrow Park downtown called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a ""welfare check"" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about ""a homeless guy sleeping"" there. Two officers respond: Because Manney didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification and said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left. Second call: About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers returned and told the employees that Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., about 90 minutes after the first call, Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked ""that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject"" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him.

Fight occurs: Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times.

Manney shoots Hamilton: The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. He fired 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. In announcing Manney’s firing, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Manney decided Hamilton was dangerous ""based solely on observations of apparent mental illness, absent any overt actions on the part of Mr. Hamilton."" Our rating Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."" Two officers twice responded to calls about Hamilton sleeping in the park and allowed him to continue sleeping there and left. He was still resting there when a different officer later and arrived and began patting him down. That triggered a physical altercation, with the officer hitting Hamilton with his baton and then Hamilton taking the baton and striking the officer. The officer then fatally shot Hamilton 14 times. In short, Hamilton was not shot simply for resting on a park bench. But the shooting occurred only because of a physical altercation that was sparked by the way the third officer began patting Hamilton down -- after two officers who came to the park twice decided Hamilton wasn’t doing anything wrong. In fact, the officer was fired for the way he approached Hamilton. Moore says Hamilton ""was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee.""

Here is a chart he assembled showing how big or small a spike each of the cities experienced:  Rosenfeld found that the 10 cities with the biggest spikes tended to have higher poverty rates, higher African-American populations and smaller Hispanic populations.
